Broke my risk management and maximum allocation rules for the 1st time to YOLO onBULL.. Position shot is from6/25. This risk was predicated on the redemption deadline of $BULLZ(6/30)..

To get bullish with $T$ all one has to do is take a view on monetization of energy& landportfolio. Time to power is one of the most important pieces of thestory. If the hyperscalars have 3 years to get to GW scale they can build their ownenergy. Oracle searching for 5 1GW+ sites ready in early 2026- who else hasthis? $IGR new update yesterday shows data center rents are verystrong. MiningBusiness.~650M,550M,450M, 300M. If bitcoin does well or network difficulty stays constrained this can be muchhigher. If AI takes as much energy as peopleestimate, mining will only be done in markets with extreme poweroversupply. Cumulative cash flows = 2B($9 per shareundiscounted) though all of this will be reinvested. Horizon 1& 2. 125M EBITDA($1.25M/MW)-. valued at$12M/MW(100 MW ITload, 150MWgross) =1.2B value($5.5/shr).

Potential Value if Monetized in aTime-To-Power Advantage Based on Precedent Transactions =$6M-12M/MW =22.25B to44.5B =$98-$196/SHR. If some of these were used forcloud, value creation would behigher, so no use distinguishing. Horizon illustrates the value captureclearly, costs 350M yet will deliver60M-75M EBITDA valued at15-20x, or900M-1.5B, thus captures7.3M-20M/MW invalue. Even at750k/MW on1.92M/MW data center revenue($160/kw/mo 2024avg.rent, Cushman&Wakefield) you get valued at15M/MW on a 7Mcost, creating8M/MW ofvalue. At extremely low multiple for data center of 15 x750k/MW =11.25M/MW, capturing4.25M/MW or 16B across the portfolio =$70/SHR. What initially gave me conviction- comparing3.5 cents/ kwh vs 6 cents for naturalgas, >10 cents fornuclear, saves220-570k/MW/yr. Capitalizing that along with other costs at 15x gives3.3M-8.5M/MW value from energy savingsalone.

ExecutiveContext: Power Is Now theBottleneck.AI‚Äôs exponential growth is colliding with a fundamentalconstraint:electricity...By2028,U.S. data centers are expected to consume12% of thenation‚Äôselectricity‚Äîup from just4% in2023...Some hyperscale campuses are projected to demand over 1GW, equivalent to powering800,000homes...This new reality is shifting power availability from a"consideration" to a strategic constraint that can determine the success or failure of a data centerbuildout..1. Power Access Has Surpassed All Other SiteCriteria..84% of developers now rank power availability among their top threeconsiderations, far surpassing fiberproximity,regulations, and laboraccess...A yearago, fiber was the topconcern‚Äîthis shift underscores how pressing the power situation hasbecome..2. Power Delays Are WidelyUnderestimated..Data center developers are underestimating grid connection timelines by1‚Äì2years...Forexample, inhigh-demand markets like Northern Virginia andPhoenix, developers think they can get power by2026‚Äì2027, while utilities are forecasting 2028 orlater...This gap reveals a growing disconnect and puts urgency on alternative solutions like onsitegeneration..3. AI Adoption Is Driving a MassiveScale-Up in PowerNeeds..The median AI data center size is projected togrow:..From ~175 MWtoday..To ~275 MW by2030..To ~375 MW by2035..Much of this growth is tied tohigh-power chips like $NVDA Blackwell(~1kW perGPU)...Many facilities will also merge training and inferenceworkloads, further compounding the energydemand...There's also a significant shift to DC(directcurrent)architectures, borrowed from EV batterysystems, to better manage the power flow forwater-cooled racks andhigh-densityservers..4. Onsite Power Is the NextFrontier..Use of onsite power generation is expected to triple by2030:..38% of facilities will incorporate onsite generation(vs.13% a yearago)...27% expect to be fully powered onsite by 2030(up from just1%).. Reasonsinclude:..Faster deployment(vs. waiting on gridexpansion)..Control overreliability..Load flexibility for AIworkloads..However, air permitting could become a keyhurdle‚Äîespecially in‚Äúnon-attainmentzones‚Äù with strict emissionsrules.

I think jphy launching their $2 billion ETF last week and europe was where the money camefrom..the russell was leading all indexes lastweek..Today, Cleveland cliffs is closing 6mills..US steel has closed one down near stLouis. The two main iron ore mines in Minnesota aredown.Trump's attempt to save the steel industry is failing sofar. Steel did jump up to $950 and fell back down because oftariffs. But no one isbuying. Cliffs shutting down pretty much all its operations says alot.. The big beautiful bill is going to benasty. It is cutting Medicare and Medicare to working agepeople. That will hit the medicalfield..plus, debt topped $37trillion. Add $4 more if Trump gets hisdeal..dollar iscrapping. Gold is in recordterritory.¬†. Trump has also slashed funding for food banks and made getting snap benefits nearlyimpossible. This will hurt grocery stores and cause food inflation tohit..plus, increased theft from people starving to death from no food banks or food stamps to eaton..the food bank I volunteer at is shutting down July31.. Trump also seems to be targeting Democratic states to cutfunding. I live in Illinois and all kinds of programs are shuttingdown.Npr,libraries, foodbanks, summer meals forkids, daycare,etc.. regardless of yourviews,that's money no longer makingit's way to mainstreet.¬†. Trump keeps talking taxcuts. But the tax cuts are already inplace.It's nothingnew.He's bragging on$5.1 trillion in new FDI but whining about Powell keeping the interest rateshigh..I think Trump is trying to fast talk the world into doing what he wants like he did to build trumptowers..with no real pieces inplace, he needs the fed to lend before everything fallsapart..plus, he keeps saying he made a deal with China whenit's the samedeal..tech for rareearths..yet, Ford shut down their factory in Chicago over not having magnets fromChina..why would Trump need to get 3 of the same deals with China? I stillhaven't seen anyone sign anything in aceremony. What happened to the 60 countries blowing up lutnicks phone to make a deal in April??. BRICS nations are up to 40 countriesnow.India, China beingTrump's top 2 to get a trade dealwith.But, Saudi Arabia joined the BRICStoo. That means they jumped ship on only accepting us dollars for theiroil..they are accepting local currenciesnow.I'm pretty surethat's why the money is heading toEurope. Everyone knows usa debt and lack of use as a global currency is gonna be a huge currency drop in value as soon as everyone figures itout..Bitcoin may shoot up to1/4 million from just the US dollar realizingit'sdebt.. Then comes this quantum computingthing...do you know what happens to chip stocks if quantum computers replaces classic computers?You'll see Nvidia pull an Enron in a flash if $T$ or qubt really has mastered quantumcomputers. NASA and Tesla is testing qubt as wespeak. I think ai is overplayed rightnow. It will grow more later as thingsdevelop.But, everyone has an AI programnow..grok,chatgpt,deepthink,palantir,Nvidia,etc. no one is a leader on AIanymore.It'scommon..but these quantum computers are going to be like going from a horse and buggy to a modelt. Nvidia might get left behind and everyone buying their data centers might be sitting on worthless technology in a fewyears. That might be why the entire Nvidia board of directors is dumping stock rightnow..Huang even saidit's moving faster than he originallysaid... I think things are a lot more uncertain than Trump and his team aresaying..Trump has bullied the media intosilence. So no one is testing what he saysanymore. He surrounded himself with yes men journalist and no one is able to challenge him or karolineleavitt. He keeps promising themoon, but Idon't see anything happening other than fighting Israel and Saudi Arabian war and a downturn in organictrade...oh, and23,000 trucking companies have gone bankrupt thisyear. Freight prices are solow, owner operators are running at less than break even prices trying to stay inbusiness...corn is down to $3 a bushel fromBrazil.It's recession in every industry but chips and banks rightnow...unemployment is gonna hit aftersummer..restaurants are showing discretionaryspending... And government economic reports are beingfalsified...Jerome Powell said hedoesn't trust themanymore. Bottomline:tru.p is bullshitting and the real economy isshrinking..q1 GDP was minus.5%...

Buy your favourite homebuilder, mortgage company and real estatebroker. You will notice they are low with rates st their highest in thecycle. I will be buying $T$ calls insize.. You can also short your most hated health insurer as the income they make from fixed income investments will be lower as bond yieldsfall.. Buying IWM calls is not theone. If rates fall0.5%(look at Fed Funds rate vs 1 yrtreasuries,it‚Äôs priced insomewhat) small businesses are not going to immediately hire more staff or make more revenue but the housing market will indeed be unlocked and transactions will flow again if mortgage rates can come down0.5%-1%.

First post on this sub and honestly most ofReddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily(7 days aweek) intense due diligence and research starting around May21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of thedecade.Don't just read to the executive summary and try and pokeholes. Read the whole thesis and at the veryleast, consider the"investmentcommittee" rebuttals at theend. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposingresearch,please, let this be an opendiscussion!.Note: references to"days ofblackout" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June26,2025..Rating:**OVERWEIGHT** | PriceTarget: $120(216% upside within 12months) |Risk:**MEDIUM-HIGH**.**INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY**. We identify ahigh-probability convergence scenario whereby $T$Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next1-45days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetricrisk/reward opportunities in the currentmarket, driven by simultaneous insider tradingblackouts, regulatorycatalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policyalignment.. Key InvestmentHighlights:.	‚Ä¢	RegulatoryMoat: NuScale remains the only $SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission designcertification.	‚Ä¢	PoliticalTailwinds:Trump‚Äôs May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclearpartnerships.	‚Ä¢	CorporateNecessity:Apple‚Äôs $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseloadpower.	‚Ä¢	TimingConvergence:44-day $AAPL insider blackout +27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminentannouncement.**EXECUTIVESUMMARY**. The convergence of corporate necessity(Apple‚Äôs AI energydemands), regulatory positioning(NuScale‚Äôs certificationadvantage), and political framework(Trump‚Äôs nuclear renaissanceagenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investmentopportunity. Our30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesisinception.. Base Case Scenario(70%probability):Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives200-300%appreciation. Bull Case Scenario(25%probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives400-500%appreciation. Bear Case Scenario(5%probability): No partnership with any major playermaterializes, limited downside given current valuation($20-$25/share).**CONVERGENCEANALYSIS**. Corporate StrategicAlignment.Apple‚Äôs AI InfrastructureImperative: Thecompany‚Äôs February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across ninestates, requiring significant baseloadpower. Unlike hyperscaler peers(Meta,Microsoft,Google) who have secured nuclearpartnerships, $AAPL represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructureplayer..NuScale‚Äôs CompetitivePositioning: As the onlyNRC-certified $SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities(12 modules in production via Doosanpartnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demandaccelerates.. Political EconomyFramework.Trump‚Äôs nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support forprivate-sector nuclearpartnerships, particularly those supporting AIinfrastructure. Theadministration‚Äôs goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive privateinvestment, makinghigh-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating marketviability..

First post on this sub and honestly most ofReddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily(7 days aweek) intense due diligence and research starting around May21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of thedecade.Don't just read to the executive summary and try and pokeholes. Read the whole thesis and at the veryleast, consider the"investmentcommittee" rebuttals at theend. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposingresearch,please, let this be an opendiscussion!.Note: references to"days ofblackout" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June26,2025..Rating:**OVERWEIGHT** | PriceTarget: $120(216% upside within 12months) |Risk:**MEDIUM-HIGH**.**INVESTMENT THESIS SUMMARY**. We identify ahigh-probability convergence scenario whereby $AAPLInc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next1-45days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetricrisk/reward opportunities in the currentmarket, driven by simultaneous insider tradingblackouts, regulatorycatalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policyalignment.. Key InvestmentHighlights:.	‚Ä¢	RegulatoryMoat: NuScale remains the only $T$ with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission designcertification.	‚Ä¢	PoliticalTailwinds:Trump‚Äôs May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclearpartnerships.	‚Ä¢	CorporateNecessity:Apple‚Äôs $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseloadpower.	‚Ä¢	TimingConvergence:44-day $AAPL insider blackout +27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminentannouncement.**EXECUTIVESUMMARY**. The convergence of corporate necessity(Apple‚Äôs AI energydemands), regulatory positioning(NuScale‚Äôs certificationadvantage), and political framework(Trump‚Äôs nuclear renaissanceagenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investmentopportunity. Our30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesisinception.. Base Case Scenario(70%probability):Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives200-300%appreciation. Bull Case Scenario(25%probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives400-500%appreciation. Bear Case Scenario(5%probability): No partnership with any major playermaterializes, limited downside given current valuation($20-$25/share).**CONVERGENCEANALYSIS**. Corporate StrategicAlignment.Apple‚Äôs AI InfrastructureImperative: Thecompany‚Äôs February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across ninestates, requiring significant baseloadpower. Unlike hyperscaler peers(Meta,Microsoft,Google) who have secured nuclearpartnerships, $AAPL represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructureplayer..NuScale‚Äôs CompetitivePositioning: As the onlyNRC-certified $SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities(12 modules in production via Doosanpartnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demandaccelerates.. Political EconomyFramework.Trump‚Äôs nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support forprivate-sector nuclearpartnerships, particularly those supporting AIinfrastructure. Theadministration‚Äôs goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive privateinvestment, makinghigh-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating marketviability..

There was a recent Odd Lots podcast with Michael Cembalast(of JPMorgan) and at about the 47 minute mark the small modular reactor situation wasaddressed. His main pointswere:.1. Despite many years oftrying, nobody has actually built one in the USA and a couple built in China and Russia went way over budget(and both China and Russia should have cost advantages over theUSA)..2. The idea isseductive, but nuclear reactors are not something that can be commoditized like solarpanels,batteries, and wind turbines(which all benefit from a learning curve that can dramatically reduce cost of production because millions or tens of millions of units areproduced). Nuclear reactors remain capital intensive and capital intensive projects require scale foreconomics..3. Cembalast says the costs per MW at NuScale went from $3 million to $20 million and they stillhaven‚Äôt builtone.. My personal aside is back in1976-82 I was a nuclear reactor operator on a NavySubmarine. The Navy has a history of building small modular reactors for submarines and ships that stretches back to the1950‚Äôs. SMRs are essential for submarines and the cost for the Navy is orders of magnitude higher than what the commercial vendors arepromising. Physics has notchanged. Everything I have ever read about from the small reactor supporters are old ideas which have been implemented experimentally in one way or another(not atscale, inexperiments). I am very dubious about the commercial application of smallreactors..Also, as a personalaside, Idon‚Äôt think $T$ would touch this business with a 100ftpole.I‚Äôd bet anything that is a total chatGPThallucination.

$SMR was going to sell Utah a gigawatt of SMRs for $3B(2015.) In2023, when cost overruns and regulatory burdens similar to those Westinghouse experiences with its old school LNMRs drove the price to$9.3B for a 462MWinstall, and the forecasted operating electricity pricesweren't competitive with fossil even after subsidies were factoredin, Utah cancelled theproject.. Tim Cook knows nothing about how to operate a nuke plant and certainlydoesn't want the PR fallout from putting nuclear reactors inanyone'sbackyard. And these SMRs are designed to be put in yourbackyard. For thatmatter, Tim Cookdoesn't seem to think AI mattersyet.. So everything in this pitch is wrong andregarded.. Long $T$

Great for $T$ possibly catastrophic for$NVDA. My read of this is that OpenAI is moving towards alternatives to bleeding edge but very expensive Nvidiachips, especially considering the fact that they are usingAlphabet‚Äôs olderTPUs.. For$NVDA, this could absolutely blow up their‚Äúselling shovels in a goldmine‚Äù narrative that has been keeping their valuation sohigh. Not sayingit‚Äôs over for them but there will be a correction and theywon‚Äôt have the same ludicrous growththey‚Äôve had these past couple ofyears.

BroI've been holding 800 shares of $T$ on MARGIN since it crashed to 183 monthsago. I highly highly highly suspect alot of retail bought low too and market makers want us to tap out of patience or keep paying interest on margin used for theshares. The whole narrative on lack of AI innovationdoesn't justify the share price being20% below highs while sp500 sits at recordhighs. Im not selling until 230 atleast

Consulting exists because we have limitedtime. Every person is aconsultant. We all do it because we"knowthings' othersdon't. So they ask us how to change a flattire. We tell themhow.

This is the biggest question outthere.. If tariffs are calledoff, Powell will cut because labor market issoftening. If tariffs are put backon, Powellwon'tcut, worried aboutinflation.

ButTrump's ego vs his desire for lower interestrates,I'm not sure which onewins, butI'm kind of leaning onego.It's the one consistent thing in his wholelife. Idon't thinkhe's ever said sorry or appeared to back downpersonally. Idon't think he can put the blame on anyone else either without keeping tariffshiked, which is his other constant play in life(blame someoneelse).. Maybeit's going to be ego + insider trading and let his friends knowhe's going to tank the marketagain. I could believethat.. Honestly not sure on theplay. Puts are cheapnow, so that could be aplay. Gold seems to have topped and is comingdown. Cash is alwayssolid, but we could have an even faster meltup ifthere's no tariffs thatyou'llmiss.. Idon't thinkit's pricedin,though. Ifanything,what's priced in is the current state of thetariffs, like10% oneveryone, and all the other newtariffs, if thateven.. My conviction play is $T$ Its PE is superlow, andthey've got all that sweettech, especiallyWaymo, which is crushingit. I doubtit'll go down more than theSPY.Plus, limited exposure to tariffs ongoods. The more the dollarcraters, the higher their income will be due to currency conversion from otherplaces.

Let me be a little moreclear, since it seems no one noticedthis‚Ä¶. $T$ ismid-squeeze, and itwasn‚Äôt exactlysubtle. I posted about it ~20 minutes ago and got hit with a couple of dismissivereplies, but the signs were allthere: hugevolume, tightconsolidation, loaded call OI, and obvious shortpressure. Thiswasn‚Äôt luck‚Äî it was visible if you werelooking.. I grabbed July 11 $5 calls at$0.50 thismorning. They nearly tripled byclose, and I more than doubled myposition.Didn‚Äôt trim yet‚Äî holding for that$1.50+ pop that could hit first thing tomorrow if this momentum keepsup.. Not saying this goes fullmeme, but if we see another volume surge and a clean move through$6, the next leg could be nasty(in a goodway). Shortsaren‚Äôt outyet, and the floatisn‚Äôt exactlyhuge.I‚Äôm ready to lock gains if it losessteam, but I like therisk/reward whereI‚Äôm sitting rightnow..Again, not pretending to be a marketwizard.I‚Äôm justsaying: this squeeze was obvious if you were paying attention‚Äî and there still might be more gas in thetank..TLDR: Up100%+ on $BBAIcalls, squeeze looksreal, watching premarket forcontinuation.

As of thispost, $T$ is valued at$654M. I[previously posted some DD on $SANA]( am now up over50% on 37625 shares at the current price of$2.90.Here's why I believe $SANA can 15X or more from here to a price of at least\~$43 corresponding to a market cap of\~$10Bminimum..**Background**. $SANA has technology that they use to modifylab-grown cells so that the cells are not rejected(killed) when transplanted into apatient. The genetically modified cells are referred to as"immuneevasive"cells. As a proof ofconcept, $SANA modified donor pancreatic islets(islets are cells that regulate blood sugar and produceinsulin) so that the donor pancreatic islets would be immune evasive and could be implanted into a human recipient patient without beingrejected. In type 1diabetics, they are missing the cells that produceinsulin, so replacement islets are a known cure for type 1diabetes, but getting them to survive without immunosuppression has been an impossibletask. One patient was implanted with immune evasive islets by $SANA onDec.2,2024. The patient did not need to take immunosuppression after receiving the immune evasive donor pancreatic islets in order for the transplanted islets to survive(normally donor islets arerejected/killed within a coupleweeks).. 6 month data from theDec. 2 transplant was just released this past Monday(June23,2025) and revealed that the transplanted immune evasive pancreatic islet cells were still alive and functional(producinginsulin), eliminating any doubt that$SANA'S tech will enablelab-grown cells to survivelong-term in patients([source]( This is the FIRST AND ONLY TIME that human IMMUNE EVASIVE CELLS have been transplanted and demonstrated to SURVIVE LONG TERM in aHUMAN. In otherwords, $SANA now owns unique technology that will be vital for not just enabling a type 1 diabetes cure(the survival of transplantedlab-grown pancreaticislets), but any therapy or cure that involves avoiding rejection while transplantinglab-grown cells or tissues into apatient..It's worth noting that for type 1 diabetes in particular is an autoimmunedisease, meaning thepatient's own immune system kills off their insulin producingcells. For thisreason, aside fromrejection, immune evasion is essential to a type 1 diabetes cure just due to the nature of thedisease. Genetically matched islets would still have their insulin producing cells killed off without immune evasivetechnology..**What's next for$SANA?(transplanting immune evasive stem cell derived pancreaticislets)**.$SANA'S initial transplant study in 1 patient used pancreatic islets from a deceaseddonor.Obviously, this is not a scalable source of the pancreatic islets needed to cure type 1diabetes. $SANA recognized this and has already produced pancreatic islets from stem cells that are immuneevasive. They have a master stem cell line with the immune evasive edits(that is now very well characterized to avoid unwantedmutations) that they can use to grow as many pancreatic islets as they want in the lab fromscratch. These are referred to as"stem cell derivedislets". Scientists are very good at growing functional islets from stem cells in the labnow, so this is not a problem that $SANA has to worryabout. The islets they can produce from their immune evasive stem cell line are functional enough to cure type 1diabetes. A recent ongoing trial from anothercompany,Vertex, demonstrated that stem cell derived islets can be used to cure type 1 diabetes([source](however,critically, Vertex has no solution for the rejection problem and the patients in their study had to take immunosuppressants to avoid rejecting the stem cell derivedislets. 1 of the 14 initial patients inVertex's study DIED due to being on the immunosuppressants(which severely weakens a patients immunesystem, making them vulnerable to simpleinfections). The patient died from a fungal infection known to affect people on immunosuppression and that people with healthy immune systems would have normally avoided([source](. $SANA has now made immune evasive stem cell derived islets which are known to be functional enough to cure type 1diabetes.Vertex'strial, which relied on deadlyimmunosuppression, confirms beyond any doubt that stem cell derived islets can cure type 1diabetes. Considering$SANA'S recent 6 month data in the first human patient transplanted with immune evasiveislets, it is now essentially known that$SANA'S immune evasive stem cell derived islets will last long term in patients withoutimmunosuppression, since they use the same immune evasive tehcnology that worked in the first humanpatient.Thus, all that remains at this point is for $SANA to start human trials with their immune evasive stem cell derivedislets.Sure, they have to go through thetrials, but the current evidence overwhelmingly indicates that$SANA'S immune evasive stem cell derived islets will besuccessful..**Competition**. $SANA is light years ahead of any potentialcompetition. They are the only company with demonstrably successfullong-term immune evasivetechnology. There are 2 othercompanies, Vertex and$CRSP, that claim to be working on immune evasive pancreaticislets;however, none of these 2 companies have demonstratedlong-term working immune evasivetechnology.Moreover, theywon't simply be able to copy$SANA'S tech since it will violate theirpatents. In order to even compete with $SANA regarding immune evasivecells, Vertex and $CRSP have to come up with an alternative immune evasive technology that $SANA has not already patented and that demonstrably works in humanslong-term. This is not a trivialfeat. Both companies are severely behind$SANA. Both $CRSP and Vertex list their immune evasive islet therapies as"researchstage" on their pipeline pages([sourceVertex]([sourceCRISPR]( In otherwords, they have no real chance of catching up to $SANA any timesoon, and they maynever.. While Vertex has transplanted stem cell derived islets into humans that cure type 1diabetes, as mentionedabove, the patients needed to be on immunosuppressant drugs to avoid rejection of the transplantedislets. 1 out of 14 patients DIED due to immunosuppressioncomplications. This is a LETHAL FLAW in the Vertexapproach. The tradeoff of curing type 1diabetes, but permanently weakening your immune system and greatly increasing chance of death due to simple infections is simply unacceptable for nearly all type 1 diabetespatients..**How much is a type 1 diabetes cureworth?**.Let's look at some statistics to get a ballpark idea to guide us in valuing a type 1 diabetescure.. Approximate number of type 1 diabetics in UnitedStates:1.5 millionWorldwide:9.1 million([source](. Average lifetime cost of type 1 diabetes per person in the United States is $500K([source]( Giventhat, a reasonable cost for a type 1 diabetes cure might be some number less than$500K. For the sake of coming up with someestimate,let's assume that $SANA charges $100K for their type 1 diabetes cure(it could be more or it could beless).. Assume cost of type 1 diabetes cure is$100K:. $100K(assumed treatmentcost)\*1.5 million currentU.S. patients = $150BU.S.revenue. $100K(assumed treatmentcost)\*9.1 million current global patients = $910B globalrevenue. But what about new cases of type 1 diabetes eachyear?. About52,000 people in the US and503,000 people globally are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year([source](. $100K(assumed treatmentcost)\* 52K newU.S. patients =$5.2B new yearlyU.S.revenue. $100K(assumed treatmentcost)\* 503K new global patients =$50.3B new yearly globalrevenue.Again, these are just ballparkestimates, but the point is that a type 1 diabetes cure is a MASSIVE on the order of $100B to $1Topportunity. Certainly a company like$SANA, which has a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands is worth more than a measly $654M marketcap, even factoring in things like potential dilution(more on that in abit)..What's even more mind blowing is that$SANA'S immune evasive tech unlocks all sorts of other currently impossibletherapies. Anylab-grown cell or tissue therapy will need$SANA'S proven immune evasive tech in order towork. Companies developing things likelab-grown liver tissue or blood vessels may license$SANA'S immune evasivetechnology, or $SANA may simply develop the therapiesthemselves. Takentogether, $SANA has the potential to grow into a massivecompany. A $1T valuation further down the line would not be out of the question if they play their cardsright. The market opportunity they have is not justmassive, but legendary insize..**Investor concerns(and why youshouldn't beconcerned)**. At themoment, there are 2 main concerns that $SANA investorshave:.1. $SANA is running out ofcash. They only have2-3 quarters of runwayleft. This istrue;however,here's why youshouldn't beconcerned. Quitesimply, $SANA has monumentally gooddata, and a type 1 diabetes cure on theirhands. As was just discussedabove, the market opportunity ismassive. So massive that investors will not let the company run out ofmoney. Since the amount of money to be made is so large and the impact sogreat, someone will foot the bill to keep the lightson.It's just a question of who and how much they willinvest. And what the investment will looklike.. Some of the largest investors in $SANA are Arch Ventures and FlagshipPioneering, 2 of theworld's largest biotech $VCfirms. Neither of these VCs has sold much of their initial stake and are likely underwater on their positions considering $SANA launched with $700M in funding(more reason to not anticipate too muchdilution)([source]( JeffBezo's fund Bezos Expeditions is also an original $SANAinvestor. It might be an extremeexample, but Bezos could invest $1B in $SANA likeit's nothing(he's given several $100M donations to various people in thepast, why not help realize a type 1 diabetescure?). The pointis, there are wealthy people who want to see a type 1 diabetes cure realized(and/or make money offit) and together will be able to fund$SANA'S continuedoperations, especially as long as their data is promising(and it ispromising). $SANA will not gobankrupt, data and market opportunity is toogood.. An interestingthought: Since you know $SANA has to raise money in the next2-3quarters, you can logically assume that a funding announcement will likely occur within2-3quarters. This is likely to be a positive catalyst as it will provide investors withclarity. As discussed in the nextsection, Idon't expect significantdilution, which brings me to the next investorconcern..2. $SANA will be dilutedsignificantly.It's true that common methods of raising more funding for a biotech running out of cash involvedilution, but thereisn't reason to expect that $SANA would be diluted significantly if it raises dilutivefunding. Consider again how great the market opportunity for $SANA to addressis.It's reasonable to surmise that there aremany, many investors that are clamoring to invest in $SANAnow, but there is only a limited number of investors that they will be able to takeon. What happens when a deal iscompetitive? A bidding war ensues and the valuation of the companyincreases. Investors are willing to put the same amount of money into a company for less of a percentagestake..Basically, because $SANA is sopromising, any dilutiion from fundraising is likely to beminimal. In cases where a biotech startup is in a danger of goingbankrupt, but has questionabledata, dilution can be massive(e.g. on the order of90%), but $SANA is a complete oppositesituation. They may only be diluted10%. Or they may not be diluted at all if they pursue a partnership that provides upfront payments in exchange for something likeroyalties. In an extremecase, they may get adonation.Let's say they were diluted50%(this seems unlikely tome), the valuation would now be around$1.3B instead of $650M(assuming the price stays the same and number of sharesdouble). It would still be a ridiculously low valuation compared to the opportunity discussedabove.. There are a large number of funding possibilities for $SANA and competition among investors is likely to befierce. Vertex would be interested in $SANAtech, but so would Lilly(who makes insulin and whose business will suffer once a type 1 diabetes cure isavailable). This brings us to the nextconsideration. What could $SANA be acquiredfor?.**What's a reasonable acquisition price for$SANA?($10Bminimum)**. To get straight to thepoint, probably at least somewhere around$10B. $SANA is an extremely promising biotech and extremely promising biotechs have recently been acquired for around$10B. You can look in the news for several examples([example]( but you reallydon't need to look any further than Junotherapeutics, which was acquired for $9B in 2018([source]( Why do I highlight Junotherapeutics? Because many ofSana'sleadership/founders are former Junoleaders/founders. In otherwords, they are experienced and have been through an acquistionbefore. They know how to play thegame.Frankly, I would think $SANA would be worth paying even more than $10B toacquire. Their market opportunity will go far beyond type 1diabetes..**Ok,I'msold. How should I play$SANA?(not financialadvice)**. Buy shares andhold. Just buy and hold as many shares as you can as long as the valuation is under$10B. And even at $10Bvaluation, they could potentially be an even more valuablecompany, soI'd probably keep holding a stake thentoo.I've been buying shares since the all time low and my most recent purchase was at$2.63(as you can see in the first screenshotabove). Idon't think it really matters what price you get the shares atnow. Thestock, in myopinion, is ridiculouslyundervalued. Perhaps it was shorted as people worried about it going bankrupt or the tech not working ordilution, but as describedabove, Idon't think those are realconcerns.. Asalways, none of this is financialadvice. Do your own duediligence. Hopefully this is some helpful DD to get youstarted.

They need more data and morepatients! The IIT is being conducted inEurope. They may have trouble finding patients there because insurance and nationalized healthcare covers insulin andsuch..Vertex, with a clearly inferior product(requires long term immune suppression and is injected into portalvein, depositing cells intoliver), was able to get 12 patients worth of data and about 10 times as much press andattention!. If Sanacan‚Äôt recruit patients and show moredata, they will falter andfail! Operational execution iskey!

The research is interesting and will cause small spikes as newsbreaks.. The stock has return potential if you buy low and monitor it then getout.. Reasons I will sell as soon as I get a decentreturn.. Solving diabetes means no recurring prescription driving revenue.

TL;DR- Reddit switched on machine translation for India on 28 Apr2025, thereby exposing theworld‚Äôssecond-largest internet market tor/WallStreetBets. The chart above shows how $T$ is now funneling record numbers of new traffic(and thus newusers) toReddit.. India is a hugecountry. It doublesU.S. user counts on both YouTube andFacebook. Yet India is less thanone-third the size of US users onReddit. The upside here is thusenormous. If you overlayIndia‚Äôs earlysearch-traffic curve on thelaunch-to-date growth forFrance,Spain,Colombia,Mexico, andBrazil, India is clearly sprinting past everyprecedent.. The model I created on May 13 assumedFrance-style adoption rates(the yellow projectionline). The latest Semrush data shows India blowing through that benchmark(the white dotted projectionline).. Add in the bullish Anthropiclawsuit, thenow-GA dynamic product adsfeature, and Reddit Answerstraction, their current\~20%sh\*rtint\*r\*st is starting to feel a tadmis-priced.

Since the war started between Israel andIran,I've chickened my way out of potentially great profit from$ASTS..Today, i was very hopeful with my QQQcalls, butunfortunately,I've lost a big chunk of myportfolio.Regardless, the lesson was learned not to play with ODTE calls orputs.It's safe to say that my ballsaren't thatbigüòÇ.. So now I have a new plan ofaction. NO MORE SHORT CALLOPTIONS!Tomorrow, i will purchase a call option for $T$ at the expiration date of 89days. Slow and easy wins therace..

I see everyone calling you a retard orwhatever. I think this is a reasonablegamble. $T$p/e is the highestit's been in the last 6years. Generally it averages between32-33,It's almost 40now.. As you saidit's been on a tear since earnings and its due for a pullback.. My only feedback would be to maybe buy your puts in3-4 blocks over the next fewweeks, in case it stays flat for a while or has a bit of momentum stillleft. People saying things like moat and good managementdon't seem to understand that good stocks can be overbought and oversold aswell. Between July 2024- May 2025 $MSFT returned-23% because it was also previouslyoverbought.. Goodluck.

Stock market might be regarded right now but if the tariffsaren't lifted by taco(he probably will not until his trade deals are made which no one seems to even be fully cooperatingfor) then it is an inevitability for a decentcorrection. Microsoftisn't some unstoppable beast like people are making it out tobe, sooner or later the tariffs WILLhit, andit'll be out of nowhere like every other economic slowdown has beenlike.. The way I see $T$it's on a huge streak since its earnings becauseit's being viewed as a safe investment among the mania and it does feel safe consideringit's only been going up since theearnings, but it is being very overbought like yousaid, and it will take just one bad day for people to get spooked out of buyingit.. Honestly a good play and I thinkit'llprint, maybe nottomorrow, maybe not nextweek, but the market will slow down eventually as I do not see taco doing the signature taco move fortariffs. This stock is being priced as ifwe're innormal, uneventful times butwe'renot..Also, I need a good entry for this dumbass stock so I am also praying this play will be the call of themonth.
