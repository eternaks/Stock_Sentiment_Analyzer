Holding $T$ stock is a bet on strong science overcoming politicalnoise. Thecompany's coreasset,Sebetralstat, has shown strong and unequivocal clinical data in its Phase 3trials, indicating a high probability of approval on a scientificbasis. The drug is positioned to be the first and onlyoral,on-demand treatment in amulti-billion-dollarmarket, creating immense upsidepotential.Furthermore, reports that theFDA's scientific body defended the application signal confidence in thedata, and the company iswell-funded to weather the currentstorm. For an investor with a high risktolerance, the asymmetricrisk-reward ratio makes holding the position a compelling speculativeopportunity.

Update here from One Big Beautiful Bill for those whocare:.\-The bill has provisions for Orphandrugs, which say that Medicarecan't negotiate on price(CRISPR's one approved drug treats two different orphandiseases), so they will get the full$2.2M listprice.\-Biotechs benefit from theR&D tax deduction provision aswell. This makes them more attractive for acquirers who can deduct thebiotech's losses on theirtaxes. $T$ has close to$1.5B in losses over the lastdecade, so if they get acquired someone can write off that loss(at21% tax rate that is\~$300M).. Hypothetically their value is the DCF + cash + operating loss taxdeduction. They have$1.9B in cash and $300M taxshield. At a$4.5B market cap they still seem toocheap.

However the FDA already ruled that GLP 1 is no longer in short supply and all three GLP 1 receptor drugs are under Patent until2030..Pharmacy/Telehealth companies like BlueChew are able to compound Viagra(genericSildenfil) because the drug isgeneric, is a unique dosage and does not hold a New Drug patent with theFDA.

A waymo costs$200K‚Äì$600K percar, while a robotaxi costs$30K. Since you could own a robotaxi and earn money while not usingit, you would be responsible for maintainingit. Tesla would receive the data and machine learning insights fromit.. Your robotaxi could be used to pick up food andgroceries, andI‚Äôd rather have my groceries dropped off by a robotaxi than ahuman.. $T$ just has a better business model than $GOOGL and all the otherself-driving carcompanies.. Having a human in the passenger seat is more about protecting the car fromidiots.. I ownTesla.

In no particularorder:.- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely asell-the-news eventanyways..- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff instocks. $T$ highly correlated to fake internetmoney..- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting inSeptember. This is a huge precedent which now means $TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and reviewperiods. Waymo will continue to expand faster than$TSLA..- Attention now shifts to July 22earnings. Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entireworld. Analyst downgrades arecoming. $TSLA will likely lower full yearguidance..- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 andbeyond. It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions ofdollars..- Elon is still popping off about one ofMango‚Äôs closest White Houseaides. The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is notinsignificant..-$7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of thisyear..- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cutsfurther. HighP/E stocks like $TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is alsoslowing..

Every bear has had their war with $T$. Anytime you get a big drop you have to take profitsfast.

If this market ever goes into a recession/ 2022 style downturn these stocks will get smoked but no signs of thatyet.. Some big money keeping it proppedup.GL!

The Robotaxi thing seems like a very dangerouslaunch. Listening to Wallstreet Breakfastpodcast, analysts in the know were talking about how the latestself-driving tests are still revealing serious flaws in thesystems, like being unable to recognize things likeone-way signs and schoolbuses' extendable"stop"signs. One account even said it blew past a school bus and hit severalchild-sized dummies withoutstopping.. Not sure ifthere's any way to predict when the first deadly malfunction willoccur‚Äîat least not with enough accuracy to makehigh-confidence buys of puts or put debitspreads‚Äîbut I definitelywouldn't feel safe going long on $T$ for awhile.
