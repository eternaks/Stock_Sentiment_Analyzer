I'm long $T$ and get the hate theyget. But I keep getting comments that totally misunderstand the issue with OpenAI objecting to tokenizing theirshares. It was a bit cheesy but if you are at allserious, do take a look at the announcement video inCannes. Vlad actually did a great summary on a chalkboard about how this allworks..\- Tokens are backed by realassets. In OpenAIcase,it's the SPV shares owned byRobinhood. RH maintainscustody.It's basically a promise to sell the shares to the token owner whenpublic..\- This is only in theEU. Mainly because in theUS, we have stricter"accreditedinvestor"rules. Infact, this even applies to you today and forbidsnon-accredited investors from participating in these sorts of privateofferings.It's really a space for thewealthy. One side is"but we have to protect retail(dumb)investors." and the other side is"retail investors are smart and understand the risks or at least free to make their ownchoices.".\- The SpaceX and OpenAI tokens were given as a promo gift andcan't betraded. It was more of a representation of tokenizing privateshares. It was 5 minutes of the hour long announcement but99% of the post announcediscussion..\- It was amazing how quickly they did this andstock/etf token trading is availablenow..\- Perpetual futures will be here in a couple months as well which ishuge. Typical ofRH, the UX is fantastic andintuitive..\- People are also glossing over the fact that they were pretty much Crypto only inItaly,Spain,Lithuania,Poland. US& UK havebrokerage.NOW, they just**released in ALL 31EU/EEAcountries**..\- They launched tokenization of assets which ishuge. People thatdon't understand think tokens are just made up out of thinair. They arenot. They are backed by the real asset and just make transacting moreseamless. Infact, phase 2 in a couple months will allow24/7 trading of tokenizedassets. Then phase 3 also in a couplemonths, you can actually custody your own tokens on your ownwallets,swap,etc. They are starting withstocks/etf's. Theopenai/spacex was an example of something a little different(privateshares). They also mentioned real estate andart.Again... any unique asset can betokenized. I hear stufflike,"well, what if they tokenize myhouse?"Sure, if they owned yourhouse.Again, they own the private shares ofOpenAI/SpaceX. They basically took $1M worth of their owned tokens and distributed it as a promo forsignup. Sure did create a lot of FUDthough.. Bigger picture is that tokenization of real assets has tremendous potential even beyondstocks. Launch in all EU countries so quickly is a major growthfactor. New capabilities like perpetual futures and24/7 trading are in very highdemand.Yes, RH pushes boundaries but they are also large enough to know how to work withinregulations.btw... in interviews atCannes, also talked about how supportive the new SEC was and they have a seat at thetable. I feel tokenization of assets is here to stay and will be expanded to the US thisyear.(just myopinion)..

Tokenizing shares is basically acting as a bookie on the price direction ofshares. Anyone can dothat. I can dothat, which is to"be thehouse" and make a market in something Idon'town. Like taking bets on nextSunday's football gamescore. That is nothing at all like owning the actualshares, though for day trading andcasino-mentality it probablydoesn'tmatter. This is not much different than the mortgage security game played before the market crash in2008. Trade securities based on options in a security thatisn'towned. Thirdderivative. Roll theDice.. Why not offer a tokenizedBitcoin?BTC's main attraction is its limited number of potential coins(21M) based on its algorithm which makes each successive coin harder to"mine". But any financial company could offer tokens against Bitcoin and increase its availabilityinfinitely. So what is unlimited Bitcoinworth?Zero. This is the way to destroy any equity valuation above its asset(book)value. Sell tokens and it takes away the scarcity value of anyequity. This is why OpenAI(SamAltman) is fighting $T$ against tokenizing its ownstock. This is a very bad idea formarkets.
$HOOD
Negative
"It's basically a promise to sell the shares to the token owner whenpublic.". Isit,though? It would make some kind of sense if it wasthat, but so far Ihaven't seen terms or a contract statement that saysthat, just general language that the value of the token"follows" the value of the asset in some unstatedway. An SPV ismentioned, but not what it actuallydoes. If the shares are never made available to thepublic, does $T$ promise to buy the tokensback? At whatprice?. Maybe this is all written down somewhere in detail and legally binding andall, and I justhaven't foundit. I would love aURL!

Because behind all themarketing, the truth is that their agreements with Palantir and Anduril are topsecret, but they have been dropping several hints along theway:.* In the video Archer uploaded celebrating the 4th ofJuly, they used an N703AX aircraftmodel, and one of these models was recently sold in2025, I suspect to Anduril or the USarmy..* Think aboutit: why use precisely this model in the video on the Independence Day of the UnitedStates?.* On July4, the big beautiful bill was officiallysigned, which means that Palantir and Archer now have a free hand to build together the AI Foundation for the Future ofNext-Gen AviationTechnologies..* On June26,2025, Sean Duffy said the signing of the big beautiful bill is the first step in building ABrand-New Air Traffic ControlSystem..*Additionally, Archer has reiterated countless times that they plan to begin commercial operations by the end of2025, and just a couple of days ago they moved one of their aircraft to Abu Dhabi and flew it for the first time to test it in extreme humidity and temperatureconditions..* To top itoff, on June6, 2025 Trump signed an executive order to incentivize drone production in the UnitedStates, mentioning eVTOLs in several of its sections as the protagonists of“American dominance in thesector.”.

When I last posted the day before the Robotaxi“launch” that featured only10-20vehicles, supervised drivers in the passenger seat and teleoperators onstandby, I listed a bunch of reasons why I felt $T$ would drop in the“next fewweeks”:. Although Ididn’t foresee the absolutely regarded retail pump the day after thelaunch, I did what anyone with balls shoulddo:. I increased my position evenmore. My $60K put position is now a nearly $72K putposition. I cashed out of my July puts and loaded up on Augustputs.. Why did I dothis? One of my catalysts was that Elon would antagonize TACOagain. This has played out exactly as I expected and thensome. An“AmericaParty” now means Elon isTACO’senemy. This is insanely bad for all ofElon’scompanies, from $TSLA to SpaceX toX.ai and everythingelse.. Now that Elon has gonenuclear, not only will equity values of all his companiesplummet, but Elon will likely have to sell more $TSLA shares to fund his new politicalparty.. I expect a big payoff for my August puts now that $TSLA is without any meaningful positive catalysts until after earnings on July 23(atleast).. Between now andthen, more and more people willrealize:.1. How devastating the Big Beautiful Bill will be toTSLA’s 2026 cashflows with the$7,500 EV tax credit expiring and the seemingly instant death of regulatory creditsales. $TSLA may lose money on a $FCF basis as early as next quarter but almost certainly in2026..2. Elon and TACO are both loose cannons and can pop off at the mouth over a hurt ego at anymoment. Tweets trigger thealgos. THIS WILL BE A CONSTANT OVERHANG FOR $TSLA GOING$FORD. Momentum will be very difficult to ignite now that Elon has pissed off most ofAmerica..3. The true launch of Robotaxi with noteleoperators/supervised drivers will take MUCH longer than most of the Cult followersthink. Each state(includingTX) will have different bars for $TSLA to clear in order to operate atscale. Those bars just got higher with Elon starting The AmericaParty. Given that $TSLA is only a Level 2 ADAStechnology,there’s a lot of trial and error before they can operate atscale. One accident and ensuing badPR, will send the stockplummeting..4. Optimuswon’t be a popular product(ifever) until $TSLA can have the robots operating at much more human levels(movement,comprehension, performativeactions,etc.). The Asians are way ahead on robottechnology, the same way they are now way ahead on EVmanufacturing/quality.. For all those that say“believe it ornot, just buycalls”, $TSLA is now down~17%YTD. TheS&P 500 is up7% and even the pathetic Russell 2000 is up~1%YTD.. Soplease, by allmeans, keep telling meI’m stupid and that Idon’t know whatI’mdoing. Keep buying your calls even though deep down you know you are just burning your money due to the fact you are in aCULT..I’ll keep shorting every nonsensical rally that you regards trigger as $TSLA continues its overall downward trend back towards150-200..

I've been thinking about the potential of these twocompanies. $T$ has their weight loss meds fast tracked meaning they could get approved at any time forpempemvidutide, aGLP-1/glucagon dual receptoragonist, which is in Phase 3 trial for the treatment of obesity and metabolic associatedsteatohepatitis.. The stock got hit over its weight lossreport. It was ridiculous because it was based on 2 lowdoses. $HIMS has been hit after Novo said it was forcing customers to cheapercompounds. Alt isnt a big pharma company so it will sellcheaper. Compound pharmacies will be forced to stop at somepoint. All doctors who have been making a fortune are looking for alternatives because people want the drugcheaper. Ihaven't seen people on the diet drug rav sincephen-phen. Not only that but you have to take these drugsforever.. POINT here is that Alt will have to compete with the big boys but if they get into bed with Hims they will have a legup. I love Hims because I believe management is quite intelligent and I can honestly believe they are watchingAlt.. I already had 450 shares of Alt and 100 of $HIMS but plan to increasenow.

Years ago Martin Shkreli did a series of videos on how to analyze a binary event(e.g a clinicaltrial) IMO a useful watch if you can findthem.. My primary question about $T$ is if their drug is acting on the same pathways or following the same method of action as approveddrugs?. Surprisingly people seem to try drugs that work on the same protein receptors even after previous attempts at targeting those receptors fail to yieldresults. If it is targeting the samereceptors, and there is evidence to support it will actually interact with them it could be a goodbuy.

No theyaren’tstock.. But Robinhood did explain how they weredifferent, and perhaps OpenAI should ask ChatGPT to explain to their own management what this actually is and how it works and then maybe their panties would be so bunchedup.. Long storyshort: It works essentially just like any other broker handlesstocks.. When you buy shares of $T$ at yourbroker, youdon’t hold those physical shares in yourpocket, your broker holds them foryou. You have a contract where the broker pinky swears that the stock belongs to you and notthem, butreally… youaren’t placing your hands on that stock certificate any timesoon, ifever.. With this new Robinhoodstuff,it’s just likethat, but with crypto addedin. Robinhood holds some OpenAI equity and is parsing out promissory notes via crypto coins that Robinhood associates withit. Not a hugedifference, just some technology and assetchanges. You still get to trade the asset the brokerage holds as ifit’syours, butyou’re going it with crypto instead of code running on a Schwabserver.. Is it ascam? Idon’tknow, nobody outside Robinhoodknows. But on thesurface,it’s no more a scam than a traditional brokeris.

TL;DR: Companies are hiring AI agents and bots faster than they can keep track ofthem. Oneday, a script named“invoice_processor_v2” is gonna nuke payroll because no one knew it still had adminaccess. SailPoint($SAIL) is the only company making sure thatdoesn’t happen andthey’re charging by theidentity..Everyone’s aping intoAI. Butnobody’s talking about the fact that each of these bots needs alogin, accessrights, auditlogs,offboarding, just like a realemployee. And guesswhat? There are now 10x more bots than humans in someorgs.. SailPointdoesn’t sellAI. They governit..They're the middle manager for the access machines and peopleget.. They tell your CEO whichbots/regard employees arerogue, what theyaccessed, and why yourAI-powered Slack internshouldn’t have access to HRfiles.. TheJUICE:.50% of the Fortune 500 already usesthem. Already FedRAMP authorized US gov trusts them with machine identitysecurity. MOONtargets:. $30 short term if the market stopssleeping. $50 once people realize bots outnumber humansregards. $100+ if we hit full AI middle management mode and SailPoint is the one holding theleash.TLDR#2: The more bots a companyhires, the more SailPointprints..You’re not betting onAI..You’re betting on who manages AI at scale without gettingsued..

Hellofriends,I'mback. Here is $T$ $UPWK and my explanation on why I bought $150K+ inshares.. Atfirst, you see what looks like aCAT. It starts off with the twoears. Looks like a catright?.Wrong. This is the NINE TAILED FOXPattern, not just anycat. So as usual with the destruction of the hidden leafvillage, $UPWK had some rebuilding todo. A massive dump candle hits like Painhimself.. But what theydon’tsee… is that the chart neededthis. Naruto HASARRIVED. You can see his hairline being formed in thechart. Whichmeans,Naruto/UPWK is about to have some serious plot armor in the upcoming weeks andmonths.. You know what comesnext. Naruto meetsTsunade. Theydidn't show this in the show butthere's a bouncy entrance and the Chakara MassageExperience. Everyone knowsthere's a happy ending to Naruto because of his plotarmor.. For that reason I believe Upwork will breakout $17+ and bought a decentamount. This is fully shown in the TA of the chart for anyone with a $PHD such asmyself.

> Tesla has halted component purchases and paused production of its humanoid robot Optimus while engineersre-work hardware andsoftware. With only about1,000 units built and parts for1,200procured, ElonMusk’s 2024 goal of5,000 robots is nowunreachable; suppliers expect the redesign to take twomonths. Problems include overheating jointmotors, weak dexteroushands, short drivetrain life and limited batteryendurance. Leadership has shifted from departing project head Milan Kovac to AI VP Ashok Elluswamy amid wider executiveturnover. Tesla hopes to unveil a markedlyimproved,Grok-enabledthird-generation Optimus at the upcoming shareholder meeting to reassureinvestors..So... carsaren'tselling.

TL;DR:**Redwire**(**RDW**) is basically a bunch of different space focused companies focused on the new spaceeconomy. It has fundamentally upgraded its business model by**acquiring profitable defense UAV(fkindrones) specialist EdgeAutonomy**. Combined with a recent strategic capital raise(approx. $260Mgross), $T$ is now poised for accelerated revenuegrowth, improved margins(cash flowpositive), and significantly deeper penetration into defense and internationalmarkets..# Redwire"2.0": The Merged Entity& StrategicDirection.***Redwire(RDW):** A diversified space infrastructure company providing critical technology(avionics,sensors,power,structures,in-space manufacturing– like theircutting-edge antenna capabilities from theirGolden, CO"GoldenDome"facility).

Not too many space or drone stocks can saythat. On valuation alone this is a greatbuy. But really the company is just now unlocking its true potential as it emerges as one of the largestplayers..# Edge Acquisition& Recent $260MOffering. The acquisition of Edge Autonomyisn't just a revenueaddition;it's a strategic pivot towardshigher-margin defense and dronemarkets. The recent upsized offering(net proceeds intended for strategicgrowth, repayment of the Edge Autonomy sellernote, and partial repurchase of preferredstock) strengthens the balance sheet and reduces certain forms ofdilution..***DRONEPOWERHOUSE:** Edge Autonomy propels $RDW into a leading position in the tactical UAVspace, especially for US& alliednations.

The pieces are in place for Redwire to emerge as a significantlylarger, moreprofitable, and strategically vital player in the convergingspace,defense, and advanced aerial systemsmarkets..

The company is trading at1.0x revenue and getting tanked because they have $1BN ofdebt… but they just slashed theirdividend, sold their remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies(which will bring debt down to$900MM), and they could easily sell their international assets to franchisees(~50 hot light theater shops that could sell for $250MM at $5MM/ shop which is a conservativeestimate) which could easily delever them down to$650MM, a manageable amount and will take them out of any bankruptcypotential…. there is a long list of strategics(RestaurantBrands,Mondelez, $T$MD) that would pay$2-3BN for an asset of this brandquality. I see the fair value of the stock closer to$10-11(>200%upside)

Just readCloudflare’s latest update andI’m wondering if people are seriously underestimating how big this couldget.. They just launched something calledPay-Per-Crawl, which lets any website charge AI companies every time their bots scrapecontent. They work with30% of the top 1 million websites andrising.. Bydefault, all new sites using Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers unless the site owner opts in and sets aprice.. This basically means Cloudflare could sit between millions of websites and every AI model trying to train on publiccontent..

SoI'm here with myown,"To catcha..." spinoffpresentation, I callit,"To Catch aShort" because that shit was all gas and noass, all flash and nocash. it was a marketing event and the market fell forit..**Robinhood’s tokenized stocks launch isoverhyped:**.1.Robinhood’s tokenized stocks rollout isoverhyped. It is launching to only150,000 users inEurope, since US regulations still blockit. If tokenized stocks eventually become legal in theUS, every major platform will jumpin, and firms like BackedFinance, which powers xStocks onKraken, are already yearsahead..2. The idea that24/7 trading will meaningfully boost order flow is alsoquestionable.Robinhood’s own24-hour market has shown limitedtraction, and weekend liquidity will likely be eventhinner, mostly driven by retailtraders..3. Some argue tokenized stockson-chain will enableself-custody and DeFi features likestock-backedlending, but that is already happeningelsewhere, for example with bCOIN onBase, and interest so far has beenminimal. Trueself-custody is not possible yet for tokenized stocks ingeneral, since these tokens represent ownership of an SPV rather than direct ownership of the stocksthemselves.. 4 Launching its ownchain, likely an EthereumL2, will not drive meaningful revenue any timesoon.Liquidity, useradoption, and dApp development are allmulti-yearchallenges. Blockchain growth isslow,difficult, and constrained by regulation and user acquisitionhurdles..5. People love to lump Robinhood and Coinbase together as retail tradingplatforms, but their business models are completelydifferent. Coinbase earns explicit tradingfees, while Robinhood quietly marks up cryptoprices, which is a race to thebottom, especially since Vlad has already promised to remove token markups for tokenizedstocks. Coinbase pulls in twice the revenue ofRobinhood, yet Robinhood trades at a forwardP/E of 66 to74, compared toCoinbase’s already high60x. Theprice-to-sales is evenworse: Robinhood at 26 versus Coinbase at12, meaning you are paying twice as much for every dollar of Robinhood revenue compared toCoinbase..**Send it to $80 in amonth**

SoI'm here with myown,"To catcha..." spinoffpresentation, I callit,"To Catch aShort" because that shit was all gas and noass, all flash and nocash. it was a marketing event and the market fell forit..**Robinhood’s tokenized stocks launch isoverhyped:**.1.Robinhood’s tokenized stocks rollout isoverhyped. It is launching to only150,000 users inEurope, since US regulations still blockit. If tokenized stocks eventually become legal in theUS, every major platform will jumpin, and firms like BackedFinance, which powers xStocks onKraken, are already yearsahead..2. The idea that24/7 trading will meaningfully boost order flow is alsoquestionable.Robinhood’s own24-hour market has shown limitedtraction, and weekend liquidity will likely be eventhinner, mostly driven by retailtraders..3. Some argue tokenized stockson-chain will enableself-custody and DeFi features likestock-backedlending, but that is already happeningelsewhere, for example with bCOIN onBase, and interest so far has beenminimal. Trueself-custody is not possible yet for tokenized stocks ingeneral, since these tokens represent ownership of an SPV rather than direct ownership of the stocksthemselves.. 4 Launching its ownchain, likely an EthereumL2, will not drive meaningful revenue any timesoon.Liquidity, useradoption, and dApp development are allmulti-yearchallenges. Blockchain growth isslow,difficult, and constrained by regulation and user acquisitionhurdles..5. People love to lump Robinhood and Coinbase together as retail tradingplatforms, but their business models are completelydifferent. Coinbase earns explicit tradingfees, while Robinhood quietly marks up cryptoprices, which is a race to thebottom, especially since Vlad has already promised to remove token markups for tokenizedstocks. Coinbase pulls in twice the revenue ofRobinhood, yet Robinhood trades at a forwardP/E of 66 to74, compared toCoinbase’s already high60x. Theprice-to-sales is evenworse: Robinhood at 26 versus Coinbase at12, meaning you are paying twice as much for every dollar of $T$ revenue compared toCoinbase..**Send it to $80 in amonth**

$T$ BridgerAerospace.. They are an aerial fire surveillance and suppressioncompany. Basically they have planes with huge scooper buckets and recon equipment which is used to fightfire. One of their biggest contracts is with theBOI.. Big Beautiful contains an extra 100 million allocated to the BOI per year for fire suppressionservices. Now thatdoesn't sound like wholelot, butBAER's total revenue right now is 100million. Being awarded even half of those contracts would besubstantial.. The formerCEO, who is also asenator, put his shares into a blind trust right as the bill was passing thehouse. Probably to avoid conflict of interestconcerns. This is the new age of grift in America and I have no doubt in my mind a Senator who helped get this bill through will be rewarded(with thepeople'smoney)..

TLDR;. $T$ uses private companies linked to its board members to boost its books and can afford to do so due to said insiders selling massive amounts of shares making it worth theirwhile.. Having trouble offloadingvehicles? Sell to fraudster DaddyGarcia's used car company for dollars on thedime.. Having trouble offloadingdebt? Sell to boardmember's company who will mark it as lessrisky?. Someonedefaulting? Give them an extension and keep it on the books as future profit until we all dump our stock at the top and sell covered calls on the rest before the stock tanks from 400 million dollars in insider selling in < 1month.

Not that thelong-term prospects of $T$ matters for the timeline OP is operatingon, but I thought this was an interesting exchange on Odd Lots thismorning:.[.**Weisenthal:**"Now, sowho's actually buying micro strategy because youknow, I thought once the spotETFs, the spot bitcoin ETFs cameout, like this business model will goaway, and ithasn't.".**Chanos:**"No, becausethere's a wonderful sales jobthat's being done about the fact that this is an economic engine in and ofitself, and so therefore terms like"Bitcoinyield" areused, andthey've called them financial gibberish because theyare, and in fact this will get arbitraged away ultimately by companies that will do this to try to capture thatspread.. In the case of Micro Strategy issubstantial.It's still fifty billion dollars something like that of the difference between the value of the enterprise value of the company and the value of their bitcoinholdings.. But the thing that really kind of shot me into orbit on all this was when a Saylor and others thensaid,well,no, youcan't really value us on an NAV basis and so called m NAB multiple ofNAV. You actually have to also give us additional value for the amount of profit that we make every quarter from the appreciation in theasset.. And I just pointedout, Isaid,well,**that's likesaying, youknow, my whole net worth is in a housethat's worth four hundred thousand dollars that is now worth five hundred thousand dollars a year or twolater, And my net worth is not five hundred thousand dollarsnow,it's two and a halfmillion, becauseit's the value of the house plus a multiple on the increase in the profitability theasset.**"
