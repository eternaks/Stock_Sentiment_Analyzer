I sold my house and dumped everything in to $BTC at $25K-$30K last cycle.  Woulda gone in at 16k but escrow took too long.  I shoulda got a loan in hindsight.. Still holding 7 $BTC and sold a few to get my original investment out and diversify a little.. I rent an apartment for $1050 a month.

"As someone who has not worked in 10 years due to some extremely lucky call options which I parlayed into passive income generating sources, I am starting to get real worried.. I live in San Diego but I'm originally from a smaller town in California.. I know 5 people who just got laid off from $300K+ jobs in $SF and LA, they were in tech so it's not that surprising, but it all happened quite concurrently.. What's more worrying though, is that about 1/3rd of my high school and college friends who did NOT end up moving to a major city have been laid off. Many of them are in law, accounting, or working corporate jobs in second tier US cities... and none of them can find jobs. They are between 30-40, and some of them have multiple young children.. The stock market keeps rocketing upwards... but this feels like a desperate, dying breath of people trying to YOLO their savings into money that can help them survive short term, rather than a healthy society and economy growing massively.. I get that we're in the ""AI boom"", but the AI boom is the first ""boom"" that is literally erasing white collar jobs en masse. My friend told me that his department was shrunk from 30 to 5 people, and he expects that the department will require only 1 person in the next couple of years. There are AI companies who build custom software for companies to help them reduce employees. Companies just hand over all their data and they are given back AI programs perfectly tailored to their needs.... Yet, everyday, a giant green dildo. Global tariffs? Green dildo. Nuclear war with Iran? Green dildo. Massive lay offs? Green dildo.. I know it's funny, especially if you're in the investor class and don't have to work... but something is beginning to feel seriously wrong. Does anyone have answers? This is the first time in my life that I have SEEN with my own eyes massive lay offs in my own social circles, who are all people with good college degrees, from good families, making at least $150K, but mostly $200K+.. Where do we go from here? More green dildos? Green dildos until the end of time? How many green dildos can society bear on it's unemployed back until its knees give out? I would appreciate some clarity."
"AI is a fad and a misnomer - one I‚Äôm leveraging to make money - but still a fad. ¬†I will be pulling the trigger on dumping my stonks the second it bobbles.. ¬†. I don‚Äôt believe the jobs are gone permanently. Just gone until the executives figure out the tech companies are selling more snake oil (metaverse, $DDD TV‚Äôs, etc).. What all of the tech companies and executives want you to ignore is that AI isn‚Äôt actually AI. ¬†It‚Äôs LLM - Large Language Model. ¬†It‚Äôs just a fancy algorithm, that you feed information into and it spits out a human like response based on the parameters that it was fed. And still sometimes fucks up spectacularly (‚ÄúI am Mechahitler‚Äù - Grok AI, now shut down).. But still, they will improve the software and it will get better. ¬†But until we reach the singularity (Where true AI becomes aware and capable of learning), most jobs will be safe. ¬†Some jobs, which are highly rules based and standardized, will likely be reduced or eliminated (call centers, etc). ¬†. In other fields, it‚Äôs functionally useless. ¬†For instance, an AI may be capable of writing a will, but can it handle a criminal defense or tort case? ¬†. Or in engineering. ¬†It‚Äôs not going to be out there resolving the issues when we find old pipe under the ground while building. ¬†It can‚Äôt give instructions to the pipefitters and electricians. ¬†Maybe it can help me with drawings and some calcs, but not much else.. In fact - several companies have already announced that they are hiring back a large number of the people they let go.. Here‚Äôs Klarna for one example: ¬†. Then, there‚Äôs all this talk of ‚ÄúAgentic AI‚Äù that will schedule my vacation and wipe my butt when I poop. ¬†Again, if it happens, it will be acting on explicit directions from you. ¬†No actual decision making."
"honestly, in the case of tech... I see these companies *finally* ridding themselves of insanely inflated dev contracts. There are so many young coders, and a lot of them are decent. It's *super* hard to find a good job in the industry right now. . With AI, all else remaining equal, I expect productivity to stagnate as payroll falls. I'm not saying it can replace a coder yet, but it can make someone with 2-years of job experience work as if they had 4. More interesting to me is the fact that I don't need to prioritize the quantitative skills *as much* during the hiring process, which generally means I can hire someone with better soft/qualitative skills and not have to worry as much. AI can be an amazing supplement to the IQ part of your team, but it'll never do anything for the $EQ."
Apparently they were running some shady algo stuff. $FSS (Financial Supervisory Service) hit them with a $300M fine. Rumors say it might go up to $600M if the appeal fails.

Hell yeah.. Replacing my $LUNR with these guys lol.
"I bought my first and only PC on Newegg back in 2013 for $1200.  Had a i7-3770k, a $GTX 680, and a gigabyte motherboard.  It‚Äôs still trucking along to this day.  I would like to see GameStop buy Newegg."
"Today I did the financial equivalent of freebasing AI hype and slapping the buy button like it wronged my ancestors. 500 contracts. $CRWV 150C. Expiring next Friday. Because nothing says ‚Äúemotional stability‚Äù like lighting $27K on fire for a company that sounds like a crypto rug pull dressed in a Patagonia vest.. Do I have a plan? Sort of. The plan is Wall Street suddenly remembers CoreWeave is the unofficial dealer for every AI junkie in Silicon Valley. The plan is that Nvidia wakes up feeling flirty and drags the entire sector with it. The plan is that something literally anything sends this stock full anime power up mode and rips it $20+ by next Friday. That‚Äôs the plan. Is it good? Absolutely not. But it‚Äôs mine.. My thesis? It‚Äôs AI. It‚Äôs hot. It‚Äôs underloved. It‚Äôs due. If $NVDA can hit $1400 off vibes and a Midjourney slideshow, then CoreWeave can absolutely rip on pure speculation and caffeine.. If it hits? I walk into a SoftBank yacht party like I belong there and soft launch my fund: Delusional Vibe Capital.. If it doesn‚Äôt? I explain to my mom why her retirement is now tied up in something that sounds like a League of Legends champion.. My entire investment strategy is basically ‚Äútrust the vibes, ignore the Greeks.‚Äù. I‚Äôm not just long on $CRWV. I‚Äôm long on delusion.. Next Friday either I‚Äôm printing money like Jerome Powell on espresso‚Ä¶ or I‚Äôm crying into a bowl of expired ramen, Googling ‚Äúhow to sell feet pics anonymously.‚Äù. Let‚Äôs fucking weave."
"YOLO‚Äôd 500 $CRWV 150 Calls for Next Friday! No Hedge, No Braincells, Just AI-Induced Delusion"
If $NVDA can hit off vibes? Listen to yourself.
That‚Äôs actually smart. But it usually goes sideways for a while before epically skyrocketing. So ill have some losses next weeks please. Guess ill buy on Monday when it‚Äôll be over 140$ already and then stick to 135$ for the whole week. Probably sell it for a loss on Friday at 128$ after giving up all hope just to see it go up to 160$+ at markets closing. Classic $CRWV trading for me. Can‚Äôt wait for it.
If $NVDA can hit off vibes.
"I think the better opportunity in AI would've been $MRVL. Not trying to ruin your vibes but you WAY overpaid for an options contract with so little time remaining and that far out of the money. To make matters worse, you did it 500 times lol"

Why the fk is $GOOGL lower than other big tech
$AMZN thinks I want women's clothing now because I always click on items where the model's feet is visible so I can zoom in. $AMZN just doesn't understand the average consumer. Puts.
"$NVDA goes sub $100. ""The AI bubble has popped, $NVDA is absolutely cooked."". $NVDA hits all-time highs. ""Should I buy Nvidia?"""
Fun fact: If you bought $AAPL a year ago on this day....you would be negative.

I loved $GOOGL like a brother in law
"Craziest thing is that the economy has been a zombie for 2+ years now but none of this matters to the markets. Reality is that everyone‚Äôs money just depends on the performance and valuation of a few tech stocks as households are at record levels of invested capital and 40%+ of the S&P is in 10 stocks. Translation, most of the Russel 2000 can disappear tomorrow but if $NVDA is up by a couple percentage points then markets will probably not even notice. We are getting tariffs announcements on major allies and the market could not give 2 shits, it just continues marching towards ATH as $NVDA makes its way to 5T market cap. Virtually worth more than most countries at this point."

"What do you think could actually bring $TSLA down¬†. It's not: bad earnings, car accidents, high positions in the company quitting, Elon calling the president a pedophile, starting a new party. Whats left out there that could push it down below 250$"
Bought $NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 870% gain for $168K later
I bought $NVDA in 2000 because a friend told me it was a hot ticket. He was right. I sold my stake later that same year at a tidy profit to pay off what remained of my student loans. Had I held it I'd probably be able to buy myself a seat on the Board of Trustees these days.
"I bought $IBM in 2022 because I like quantum, wish me luck"
"I bought at the same time too, except it wasn‚Äôt because ‚ÄúI liked gaming‚Äù it was because $NVDA was still $NVDA and everyone knew it in 2022, and had fallen by 60%."
I bought 3 $AMD shares at 15$ and sold them a year or two later for 100$ each because i was broke.
I was making some decent money selling $NVDA puts in 2022. Eventually my luck ran out and the stock fell below my strike price and I was forced to buy the shares. Said fuck it and just kept them. Worked out pretty well for me: 
"Diamond hands, bro. $NVDA aint going nowhere. You know how many people sold $AAPL 20 years ago who‚Äôd be sitting on a Caribbean island right now if they hadn‚Äôt?"
I just did this lookup yesterday actually. You bought when chatgpt was shown off. The writing was on the walls in big bold letters. BUY $NVDA
I still kick myself for not grabbing this and $AMD back in 2018 when I first stumbled into RH $AMD was $20 and lower at the time and I was out here failing to be a option trader üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good shit
"I blew up my account in 2019 because I had a lot of credit card debt needing to be paid. I had $NVDA, $AMD, Corsair, Tesla, and Meta all because I liked gaming and EVs. Sold all of it. Every last dollar"
Now you can afford the new $RTX
"I brought $NVDA in 2022 thinking the gpu inventory due to bitcoin slump was going to be a temporary thing, didn‚Äôt know all that much about ai chips back then, sold all of my positions  after 2nd q earning with about 3x ish gain. Should‚Äôve had a little bit more patience"
I bought in 2021 because that was my graphics card brand. Same with $IBM. I just thought I use all these companies in my computers why wouldn‚Äôt I start with stocks I believe in. My profit isn‚Äôt as high as yours but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with where it‚Äôs gotten my portfolio.
I did the same thing auth $AMD...
I did the same. However I thought $NVDA already had their AI moment back in 2022-2023 so I bought the Advanced Money Destroyer (aka AMD)
"Now, imagine if you bought leveraged $NVDA shares.. I'm in NVDL."
I bought $NVDA in 2020 and it was already the number 1 Ai play
"Back in '23 i was looking around on a finance website, checking out a few stocks and their forecasts. $NVDA got my attention. It said that the minimal forecastes price is above the current price. That's obviously free money right? So that's how I made my first investments. Got me into investing."
"$NVDA gains thread?  Here's mine:. Acquired|Term|$ Total Gain/Loss|% Total Gain/Loss|Current Value|Quantity|Average Cost Basis|Cost Basis Total. :--|:--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:. Jan-11-2018|Long|+$315,365.63|+2802.16%|$326,620.00|2,000|$5.63|$11,254"
. Good to see another early nvda investor. I bought it originally because I built a PC with a $GTX 1080ti back in 2017 and I was impressed with how it performed. Then in 2018 I read about Nvidia's involvement with autonomous driving and decided to invest more.
I'll take your share volume and my cost basis. Added $NVDA because I wanted to spread exposure beyond $AMD and $MU (lol).. 
That right there is the money shot. In about 5 years that position will be worth $1.5MM and OP is gonna cash out retiring early....or he goes full regard and sells everything to buy into $NVDA calls.
I sold my nvda gain at 100% and bought $GOOGL. Fml
"Almost same. Except I bought 500 shares of $AMD because I liked gaming. And as a poor college student, $AMD products were all I could afford. When I started investing, $AMD at $6 was all I could afford. Not too mad about it though"
I chose Corsair and Tattooed Chef over $NVDA at this time and now I‚Äôm sticking to index funds lol
"I've been a gamer all my life and built every rig i owned, I never thought about investing in $NVDA because I'm blind and oblivious."
Well I bought TDFX instead of $NVDA circa 2000 because TDFX had better technology!
Never sale!!! $NVDA still got 20 years in tanks left
"As a person who‚Äôs not at all savvy when it comes to stocks, my $NVDA makes me the happiest! A friend told me to buy so I got 100 shares only - wish I had gotten more... "
I did the same with $AMD and I'm up almost 2% now!
I had the same thesis except I bought $AMD @ 75 because Intel CPUs were clearly shit. If only I thought about the GPUs‚Ä¶

"I've seen this happen before and I have been able to take advantage of it once. Did a limit order on $AMD to buy the smaller number then immediately set a sell order for the bigger number and scalped $1K in 2 seconds..

"I tried posting about this before but hoping the mods allow now that it‚Äôs well above $500 million MC. While my typical day to day market activity includes selling spreads, I have accumulated the majority of my current gains by swing/longer term investing. As you can see, I have been early many times, but never wrong. I watched my $ASTS position drop 80%+ and had to wait for the market to realize what I already knew. Similar patterns happened with most of my stocks.. I‚Äôm not going to bother with a long DD other than to say this has been one of the most hated stocks on the market and left for dead. They‚Äôre narrowing their losses, getting closer to breakeven/profitability, and not remotely close to the bankruptcy risk the current market cap is reflecting. Rate cuts are upon us (likely by September/October) and real estate stocks in general will have their own sentiment run. OPEN is one of the most volatile of the bunch.. This will be one of the easiest 2-3X you can have this year but most of you regards still won‚Äôt follow me. Long 40k shares"

$RKT is a better company.. they have their own real estate ecosystem. One of its kind.. once the interest rates comes down and people start refinancing watch for $RKT.

"Hi,. i'll keep it short and sweet. $CRM is my bet for upcoming tech earnings season. For the below reasons. \- company has been overspending on M&A which was a big mistake for a growth company that needs to have sustainable organic growth first. Now the company has finally shifted to focus on profitability and stopped its spending spree. \- They have acquired some valuable businesses/segments however the synergies are inclear. I am betting that they will give more clarity upcoming earnings call. \- Stock has flatlined since April 2nd Tariff Board Debacle, however $MSFT, $ORCL, $NOW and $SNOW have recovered nicely. $CRM looks like the $GOOGL / black sheep of the bunch but this all might turn soon.. \- Word on the street is AGENTFORCE, this is their racehorse that is supposed to make up for all the legacy software that they have been selling in the past. I believe this is a gamechanger for $CRM because of the populair demand. They have finally found their place in the a.i. revolution. . Downsides. \- Company has been spending like crazy and fumble the bag on earnings calls. They could not reassure analysts that they know they will make a profit in the future from all these acquistions. \- I am getting $GOOGL vibes from this company  meaning that we all know it has potential but it doesn't get the same love from its peers. .

"its not $GOOGL vibe, $CRM has adobe vibe"
"For some reason I actually believe that they'll do well in the short-run as the AI hype train moves on. . They have a strong in with the large group of US companies who do not know what they are doing when it comes to tech but wants to feel modern at a ""decent price"". They'll pump renewals and upgrades using the AI hype and then upsell again. . But it'll all come falling down when ROI never materializes and the squeeze comes for the minnows and regional midmarket. . (But their products are slop and I'd never recommend/use/encourage anyone to use them.  Sad to see Slack's slow descent into $CRM shit)"

" **TLDR:** The bull run in U.S. critical minerals has officially started, fueled by DoD billions and the freshly signed Big Beautiful Bill.. **Pentagon MP-DoD Deal**. The Defense Department and $MP Materials agreed to a multiyear package intended to anchor a fully U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain. The deal combines direct Pentagon funding with private credit, guarantees the plant‚Äôs offtake for a decade and makes DoD the company‚Äôs largest shareholder.. **Announcement Summary:**. * **$400 million** in DoD convertible-preferred equity (plus warrants). * **$150 million** DoD loan to add heavy-rare-earth separation at Mountain Pass. * **$1 billion** construction credit line from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. * New ‚Äú10X‚Äù magnet facility lifts MP‚Äôs U.S. capacity to **‚âà10,000 t/yr** (commissioning 2028). * **Ten-year price floor** of **$110 kg NdPr** and DoD agreement to buy **100 % of output**. * DoD stake can reach **‚âà15 %** of $MP on a fully converted basis. The critical minerals sector rallied sharply as markets reacted to two major policy events: the Pentagon‚Äôs multibillion dollar magnet-plant deal with $MP Materials and President Trump‚Äôs proposal of a 50% tariff on imported copper. Investors rotated into names that stand to benefit from U.S. efforts to secure domestic supply chains and diversify away from Chinese sources.. **Stocks in today‚Äôs move(Sympathy Rise):**. * **MP Materials ($MP): +53.78% intraday**. * **The Metals Company ($TMC): +8.61% intraday** ‚Äì Possibly driven by (1) speculative next deal potential after CEO Gerard Barron‚Äôs tweet two days ago highlighting the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù with over $7 billion in grants and tax incentives for mineral processing (very speculative) , and (2) and possibly due to Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday proposing a 50% copper tariff, which makes high grade domestic sources more valuable. TMC‚Äôs polymetallic nodules grade 1.1‚Äì1.5% copper‚Äîwell above the \~0.7% average of many land mines‚Äîin a pure, loose seafloor form requiring no blasting or waste rock handling, plus \~1.3‚Äì1.4% nickel, \~0.2% cobalt, and high manganese. (very speculative).. * **Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX): +22% intraday** ‚Äì largest U.S. copper miner and a major gold producer; tariff tailwind improves net-backs on Morenci, Bagdad and Miami output while management argues it could speed federal approvals for the Lone Star and Resolution projects (very speculative).. * **Southern Copper ($SCCO): +2.1% intraday** ‚Äì low-cost producer with \~70 bn lb of proven reserves; tariff narrative lifts its U.S. mines (Bisbee, Mission) and adds option value to undeveloped Arizona/San Gabriel assets despite Peru exposure (very speculative).. * **Energy Fuels ($UUUU): +15.6% intraday** ‚Äì only U.S. company already producing mixed rare-earth carbonate at commercial scale from monazite feed; investors betting DoD/DOE grants could finance Phase-2 separation at White Mesa, complementing its uranium-vanadium stream (very speculative).. * **Rio Tinto ($RIO): +2.7% intraday** ‚Äì diversified major; tariff benefits its 55% stake in the Resolution JV (Arizona) and lifts sentiment around the Oyu Tolgoi copper expansion (very speculative).. * **BHP Group ($BHP): +3.9% intraday** ‚Äì follows Rio; owns Escondida (world‚Äôs largest copper mine) and Nickel West, both leveraged to EV demand. U.S. tariff backdrop could enhance pricing power if Oak Dam and Jansen downstream options advance (very speculative).. The day‚Äôs moves underscore a broader strategic shift: **Washington is racing to reclaim supremacy across the critical mineral supply chain, and history suggests that when the United States commits to an industrial contest it aims for first place.**.

"I'll start by saying, I've been following this company for quite some time. I wrote this DD last night and unfortunately did not get to posting it in time. (kms). You don't have to believe me it is okay. **My thesis and everything I am about to say still remains true.** . Up 109.56% in the last year, $MP Materials ($MP), is a fantastic investment. At a price per share of $30.03, this is an absolute steal. Let‚Äôs get into why I believe so. **Edit: (Now at a price of $45.23)**. **Overview -** The company operates in the Rare Earth Element (REE) mining industry. A key part of this thesis is that they are UNITED STATES based. As a matter of fact, they are the only U.S. producer and supplier of REE‚Äôs. They fully own and operate Mountain Pass, which is a rare earth mine in San Bernardino, California. This mine has been around for quite some time, first being used in 1952. Throughout the 60‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs, Mountain Pass was the world‚Äôs dominant $REE supplier, producing over 70% of global REE‚Äôs at its peak. The most abundant ore in the mine is called Bastnasite, which is one of the three primary earth minerals. This ore contains 6%-8% of Total Rare Earth Oxide (TREO) which is considered exceptionally high by global standards. Most deposits contain 1%-4% $TREO. $TREO is a standard measurement used in the $REE mining industry to express $REE content in ore.. **Production -** Now listen up. In April of 2022, the company announced plans to build a 250,000 sqft plant in Fort Worth, Texas which it calls ‚ÄúThe Independence Facility‚Äù. This plant is the first fully integrated rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturing plant in the United States. The building has since been completed. In early 2025, the facility began commercial production of NdPr metal, and trial production of automotive-grade sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets. This marks a significant achievement for the company, and for the U.S. supply chain as a whole. The trial production of NdFeB magnets is set to switch to commercial production towards the end of 2025. This facility will have the ability to produce magnet supply for 500,000 EV‚Äôs every year, and they are already partnered with $GM for this. $MP Materials magnets will be in the HUMMER EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and more than a dozen other models. **The news of their magnets going into commercial production will be the next large catalyst for the stock.** . **What is NdPr?** Neodymium-Praseodymium is a rare earth alloy that is critical in the production of high-powered magnets which are NdFeB magnets. Neodymium provides magnetic strength while Praseodymium provides corrosion and heat resistance.. **Why are NdFeB magnets important?** They are a critical part of the modern world and supply chain. Demand in recent years has been skyrocketing as the continued shift towards clean energy continues. There are endless applications for these magnets, some of which include: Use in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, smartphones, laptops, missile guidance systems, drones, radars, fighter jets, MRI machines, and more. In a report by the S&P Global Market Intelligence, the use of NdFeB magnets in electric vehicles is expected to be the biggest driver of demand, which is predicted to increase from 7.1% of all $REE demand now, to 23.8% by 2040. The main component of these magnets is Iron at about 65%-70%, while NdPr makes up 28%-32%.. **Understanding the Supply Chain -** Now that we have established the basics, the main thesis lies in the global supply chain. For decades, China has dominated both $REE production and supply. This means they have nearly full control over NdPr, and therefore, they also control production of the highly demanded NdFeB magnets. Mining these REE‚Äôs is not as simple as taking it out of the ground. The mined ore needs to be processed which means it gets sent to China because they dominate the refinement process too‚Ä¶ In the words of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, ‚ÄúThe Middle East has oil. China has rare earths.‚Äù However, in recent years, the U.S. and other countries like Australia, have opened their eyes and realized they need their own domestic production. In 2024, the United States produced 45,000 tonnes of REO‚Äôs (Rare Earth Oxides). That represents 6.9% of the world‚Äôs total production for the year. China on the other hand, produced 270,000 tonnes of ROE‚Äôs, representing 69% of world production. So not only does China produce the most significant amount of REO‚Äôs, but they also process and refine a whopping 90% of the world‚Äôs REE‚Äôs. Their ability to do so comes from decades of investment, focused on building a vertically integrated supply chain.. It is a matter of national defense that the U.S. gets NdFeB magnets. Since 2020, the DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic $REE supply chains. Their main focus being to create a ‚Äúmine-to-magnet‚Äù process. That is exactly what the company $MP Materials is focused on becoming. As mentioned, in the latter half of 2025, they are expecting to be commercially producing NdFeB magnets. They will be the ONLY United States company capable of mining REE‚Äôs and processing them into NdFeB magnets. That is not to say there are not other magnet producers in the U.S, just none quite like $MP Materials.. This business strategy is already paying off. NdPr oxide and metal revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was $24.32 million, compared to $8.33 million in the previous first quarter. That is a 192% increase. Their NdPr production rose 330% in the same period, with sales of NdPr increasing by 246%. **When looking at things like their income statement, nothing is going to wow you. This is not a company having record breaking years by any means.** That is why we must understand the bigger picture and the need for domestic $REE production. . **RECENT NEWS: July 10****^(th)****, 2025.** $MP Materials just secured $1 billion in funding from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to build its second U.S. magnet manufacturing plant, which is called the ‚Äú10x facility‚Äù because it is set to 10x their production. This facility is set to be completed in 2028. On top of this, the Department of Defense purchased $400 million worth of stock, making them the largest shareholder in the company at 15%. The DoD is also issuing a $150 million loan to support $MP Materials expansion of their heavy rare-earth separation at Mountain Pass.. This deal sent the price flying! I suspect it will come back down for a nice buying opportunity. However, I think anything under $100 with this stock is a great deal. In the coming years, I see this stock being a top performer in the market. . Position - . "
This is Only the Beginning ($MP) $MP Materials

"Look at the rare earths china export banned. Look at how little $MP makes of the banned ones. Those heavy ree's mostly come from ionic clays. This deal was a sweetheart deal, no doubt, and one that I am kicking myself for missing, but there are no fundumbmentals at play here aside from graft."
"I bought $MP in several ‚Äòdips‚Äô after it topped out at $55ISH 3-4 years ago. Held 3,000 shares at an average price of $30 for years, all the way through rock bottom $10-$11.  Diamond hands. Was so happy to sell it off at an average of $34-$35 over the last month for a decent profit.. Felt like a genius after it was falling back to $30 and downgraded this week.. Then of course today happens and I hate myself.. Am I an idiot?"
"Solid DD, I‚Äôm a bit biased as I work at $MP but the improvement and decision making in the past 3 years has been pretty incredible looking back on it and it‚Äôs only getting better with each month. I would absolutely agree it‚Äôs just the beginning!"
"There‚Äôs no heavy $REE at MP; never has been. They plan on importing it, the pentagon deal is more for the 10x magnet plant. Not saying it‚Äôs not a good investment it‚Äôs got a guaranteed buyer now. However there‚Äôs another player building a magnet plant in $TX that is mining Heavy $REE, don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs going to work out now, but $MP will have to buy it from somewhere not China at some point."
"‚ÄúToday¬†*we*'*re doing copper*,‚Äù said¬†Trump. So I thought, ok maybe they're doing rare metals tomorrow, and bought some $MP calls. I am shocked that this play was rewarded so quickly and so bigly. "

". If the US imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods and Brazil hit back with its own 50% tariff on US products as announced, these are a sample of American companies that could face real trouble:. Mondelez (MDLZ): Brazil is a huge snack market for Oreo and Lacta. Retaliatory tariffs could raise prices and shrink demand.. Caterpillar (CAT): Brazil is a big buyer of Caterpillar‚Äôs mining and farm machinery. Higher tariffs could slash equipment sales.. Chevron (CVX): Chevron‚Äôs oil production in Brazil could face new taxes or tougher rules, cutting into profits.. McDonald‚Äôs (MCD): Brazil is McDonald‚Äôs largest Latin American market through Arcos Dorados. Tariffs could raise food costs and hurt local sales.. Ford (F): Ford still sells cars and parts in Brazil. Tariffs both ways could push up costs and dampen demand.. General Motors (GM): $GM depends on Brazilian factories and buyers. Retaliation could disrupt parts supply and hurt local sales.. Coca-Cola (KO): Coke counts on Brazil for big sales and sugar supplies. Brazil is main Coca cola market in Latin America. Tariffs on both sides will affect margins and reduce demand.. Given the US tariffs announcement are based on shallow reasons to begin with (you didn‚Äôt treat well my friend Bolsa‚Ä¶), I suspect that that these announcements will be short lived."
"Sounds like a win for China and India to me. The B in BRICS is Brazil, correct? $CAT is the biggest loser with all these tariffs they are getting hit at both ends."
"Mondelez, Coca-Cola and McDonalds likely source and manufacture stuff locally in Brazil. I doubt $MCD is shipping buns and patties to Brazil."
"WHITENET represents the kind of resilient infrastructure today's volatile markets demand. While legacy giants like Chevron, McDonald's, and $GM face regulatory and tariff shocks in Brazil, decentralized networks like WHITENET operate borderlessly, immune to political retaliation and centralized risk. As traditional finance gets squeezed by geopolitics, WHITENET offers a foundation for global, permissionless trade and real-world asset tokenization without the overhead of jurisdictional friction."

"GL, but I would have put it into $CNC"
When it happened to $UNH I bought a lot of shares at 280 and made. But $UNH drop was due to justice department investigation into fraudulent activities with Medicare and Medicaid billing which investors hoped that the CEO two came out of retirement will resolve. $CNC crash happened last week after the earning announcements due to failing to give a forward guidance as a result of deep Medicaid and Medicare costs due to the   big beautiful bill that just passed. Investors are worried that United healthcare may also issue a weak guidance due to the deep future government reimbursement  after earnings announcement which could bring the stock to new low level‚Ä¶.

Watch out what happened to $CNC could  to United healthcare after the earning call.  It lost half of his value due to Obamacare cuts in the new center bill.  Also check out Molina healthcare They dropped big time as well. This sector is radioactive.
$UNH about to get more coverage than my insurance plan.

This is your chance to right that wrong and make a shit ton of money in the process.. **SKIP THIS PART IF RETARDED:**. Thanks to $NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those $NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where $POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: [POET](. $POET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. $POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. Diagram for the mentally impaired:. Now, $POET is a pre-revenue company. However, the switch from electronic to photonic chip-level data transmission is happening *as we speak*. And so, the single most important statement of this entire DD: **POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR $CUBB AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS, WEEKS, OR DAYS.** The reason why this hasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait 6-9 months to test-run the technology before finalizing their orders -- standard practice in the industry ([Source]( In other words, the orders have ALREADY BEEN PLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfilling them: ""In fact, \[Rep. from $POET customer\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution."" [(](. With such a small market cap, a skeptic might wonder how $POET would be able to defend their valuable position in the industry. First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology ([Source]( Additionally, their various partners/customers have incorporated POET's technology into a wide variety of transmission speeds: 400Gbps, 800Gbps, 1.6Tbps, and even 3.2Tbps. Right now, 1.6T and 3.2T are not needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the coming years, they'll still be buying optical modules with POET's tech inside. Because of this, I cannot reiterate enough how well-positioned $POET is to capitalize on the AI / data center boom.. **IF RETARDED, START READING HERE:**. Knowing that $POET will start making money hand-over-fist in the near future, the next step is to calculate how much they could actually make. Taken from their Q4 2024 earnings report:. ""Established a major wafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines in Penang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer and contractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial **1 million $POET optical engines annually**."" ([Source](. But that's not all. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even more production, expected to be ready in 1 to 2 quarters:. ""POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engine assemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and **addressing growing customer demand**."" ([Source](. Because the Globetronics facility is already up and running ([Source]( I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facility alone. Again, being conservative, I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 a pop. 1M units \* $250 / unit is $250M. Multiply that by a P/S ratio of 10, and you get a market cap of $2.5B -- representing a **5X** from the current market cap of $500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in any day. But let's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in the future. $MMM units \* $500 / unit (accounting for 1.6T, 3.2T being more expensive) \* 10 P/S ratio = $15B market cap -- **30X upside** from current share price.. The best part about this situation? Wall Street doesn't care enough about pre-revenue microcaps to understand POET's potential. Once institutions take the time to understand POET's position in a rapidly burgeoning industry, this thing will practically double overnight (And yes, I know that it's already up over 50% from the recent lows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt cap requirement).. If this stock gets ANY sort of public attention, the market will quickly re-price its valuation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news (fulfilled purchase orders, revenue, new products, etc), this has the potential to go on a crazy run. The only caveat is that I can't tell you when exactly this could happen. POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue -- I'd guess orders start getting announced before September. That doesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in a month, though.. The easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill -- I am almost certain that $POET will at least double by the end of the year. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares -- go for 1/16/26 or 1/15/27 10c. The options chain is stupidly bullish, and it could easily gamma squ\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTM calls.. My base case is $12/SHARE by EOY, and $30/SHARE by Q3 2026. My optimistic case is $30/SHARE by EOY, and $45-60/SHARE (3.75B to 5B mkt cap) by Q3 2026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the right time.. **TL;DR** \-- $POET, a $500M mkt cap photonics company, is on the cusp of generating significant revenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5X return, minimum. The market is largely unaware of this stock, and it will undergo a dramatic re-pricing in the coming weeks and months. Buy into the next multi-bagger BEFORE it happens.. **Position:**. EDIT: Initially forgot about this, but they've won a bunch of awards for their technology. Doesn't really mean much for share price, but it's evidence that this whole thing isn't vaporware. . **2025 Lightwave‚ÄØAward ‚Äì ‚ÄúOutstanding AI Hardware‚Äù** ([Source](. **2025 AI Breakthrough Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúAI Hardware Innovation Award‚Äù** ([Source](. **2024 Global Tech Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúBest in Artificial Intelligence‚Äù** ([Source](. **2024 Merit Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúAI Innovator of the Year‚Äù** ([Source](. **2024 AI Breakthrough Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúBest Optical AI Solution‚Äù** ([Source]("

"Big expectations from the CEO, below is the newsletter sent to investors today ...hence the 18% jump? ..  . The latter half of 2025 looks VERY interesting...Thanks again to Steady Jerry for placing this on my radar üôè  . (NFA or a solicitation to buy or sell a stock)  . $POET Technologies Newsletter  . LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN & CEO  . Dear Friends,  . In Q2 of 2025, $POET executed on our decision to move our optical engine assembly and testing facilities out of China and into Malaysia. We opened the doors to an 8,000-square-foot space in Malaysia that holds state-of-the-art equipment and provides every tool necessary to produce 1 million $POET optical engines per year. Those engines will drive the next generation of hardware devices for the AI and data center markets.  . The manufacturing center in Penang asserts the company‚Äôs aggressive shift into commercialization. We can scale up to meet the demand from our customers who are seeking to rapidly improve AI and data center connectivity.   . Located inside of Globetronics‚Äô massive building, the $POET production floor features 25 units of equipment and a growing team of exceptional engineers. They work closely with our Asian headquarters in Singapore to bring scalable wafer-level innovation based on the $POET Optical Interposer‚Ñ¢ to reality. We also added NationGate, the largest electronics manufacturing services provider in Malaysia, as an additional assembler of our external light source products.  . Our publicly announced customers have already received samples of our optical engines and light sources, and are evaluating how they integrate with their own devices. As the second half of 2025 begins, we expect purchase orders to arrive as end-user customers qualify our partners‚Äô optical modules. With two qualified sub-contractors in place, we are in a good position to add additional manufacturing capacity to meet any further demand past the current level of 1 million units.  . You can see a video of our manufacturing facility in action here.  . Our products at the cutting-edge of the optoelectronics industry have received praise from our customers and industry observers. We just received our second consecutive AI Breakthrough Awards win, earning Best AI Hardware Innovation for $POET Teralight‚Ñ¢, our line of 1.6T ultra-high performance optical engines.  . In less than three months, $POET transformed our production resources into a full wafer-scale operation. Now, we are ready to launch the next stage of our journey. It will be the most exciting phase yet. We have just successfully concluded our Annual General and Special Meeting and are ready to pursue a fortuitous next 12 months."

"I felt this way about $POET back in January, now it‚Äôll be a pump n dump"
"This post is spot on, well researched. I concur with the bullish possibility. It could go up faster and further than this. The AI frenzy is unlike anything we have ever seen in terms of rapid investment of hundreds of billions, and $POET helps leverage these dollars with more energy-efficient connections. Energy efficiency and speed are the product of POET's devices, and they've done it in a cost-effective, scalable manner. This is a potential rocket for these reasons. Beyond data centers, there are further markets in fiber networks to homes and businesses, cellular networks, sensors and Lidar for vehicles; all can benefit from a tiny chip that converts electrical signals to photonics. These lower-cost markets could license the tech from $POET, a pure profit arrangement, while $POET concentrates on the high-margin data center markets. Potential rocket ship."

"Decent write-up, but this reads more like a hype piece than a sober DD. POET‚Äôs tech sounds legit *in theory*, and the photonics bottleneck is real ‚Äî nobody‚Äôs disputing that. The problem is the massive gap between ‚Äútesting phase‚Äù and ‚Äúrecurring revenue.‚Äù Pre-revenue companies are graveyards for investor capital *unless* there‚Äôs a proven ramp + real demand + execution.. Yes, the partnerships are interesting (Foxconn, Mitsubishi, etc.), but ""partnership"" ‚â† revenue. Hyperscalers test dozens of components and only scale up a handful. Until $POET shows actual POs being fulfilled at scale, all these projections are speculative.. Also, slapping a 10x P/S multiple on a pre-revenue microcap is optimistic at best and misleading at worst. Those valuations come *after* revenue is growing and margins are proven ‚Äî not before. Right now, this is still a bet on management, execution, and market timing.. TL;DR: Interesting company, and photonics is a real tailwind, but don‚Äôt confuse a good story with a good investment. Size accordingly and don‚Äôt mortgage the house on Reddit hopium."

"Waited to have a post about this stock as it has just come out of penny status and now has a 1b+ market cap as of yesterday.. If you‚Äôve been sleeping on $NAK at ~$2.10, ($2.20 in premarket), wake up.. Northern Dynasty is deep in settlement talks with the EPA to reverse the 2023 veto on the world-class Pebble copper-gold-moly project in Alaska, with a joint status report due July 17, 2025. CEO Ron Thiessen calls these negotiations ‚Äúthe fastest path forward‚Äù for withdrawing the veto and getting the Army Corps back to permitting, which would instantly unlock one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits on the planet.. Pebble‚Äôs last resource estimate (Dec 2017) clocks in at 6.46 B tonnes grading 0.40% Cu for 56.9 bln lbs of copper, plus 70.6 moz gold, 3.4 bln lbs moly and 344 moz silver. With a market cap of just ~1 billion, that works out to an EV of only roughly $0.016 per pound of contained copper ‚Äì versus the $0.16/lb average paid in recent M&A for similar assets.. Macro tailwinds are enormous. For example, President Trump‚Äôs 50% tariff on copper imports kicks in August 1, 2025, explicitly to ‚Äúrevitalize the domestic copper industry‚Äù and strengthen national security.. **Key upcoming dates to be aware of**. July 17, 2025 EPA status report, if they greenlight additional info, the intention for veto withdrawal could follow fast. August 1, 2025 50% copper tariff goes live . And in the unlikely event that the settlement falters, Northern Dynasty and Alaska will push appeals. Alaska even petitioned SCOTUS in July 2023 to overturn the veto (direct bid was denied Jan 8, 2024) but can re-route through lower courts and back to the Supreme Court later, inevitably in my opinion the Supreme Court will overturn the veto but this would take many years to play out.. The bear case is they have filed for an offering for a total of $75 million, currently they have a good amount of cash on hand from selling royalties on gold/silver production and I suspect they will want to raise money on a big pump following intention to withdraw veto to fund initial assessments and put themselves in a better position to negotiate with a larger mining player to finance development in exchange for sharing the profits.. Full disclosure, I am holding shares (30k exactly at $0.65 average) and looking to sell half above $4, in the event of approval to hold the rest long term until production. . [Full share position](. **TLDR: $NAK = regulatory binary + copper supercycle + tariff play + tight float = asymmetric YOLO. High risk, MASSIVE reward if they pop the veto or win in court.**"

"I put money into RH ~5 years ago. This was my ‚Äòplay‚Äô money account and never considered it my ‚Äòserious‚Äô money. . Through various life events, things got more and less stressful with this account. It was especially stressful after the account reached ~100k in Jan/Feb 2024 and I was locked into $MSTR calls. I cashed out and saw those calls become worth over 800k.. it was very stressful thinking about the woulda/coulda/shoulda. So naturally, I chased it just to piss nearly all that 100k away throughout 2024 on various ‚Äògambles‚Äô because I thought I knew it all. . Long story short. Everyone was hating on Boeing (many people still do). I saw an opportunity. I started investing in long calls. It‚Äôs not particularly ‚Äòfun‚Äô to invest in a blue chip stock long calls like you crazy 0DTE‚Äôers do, but I consider it a great American company. And there are tax benefits to long term vs short term gains (capital gains tax). . I can easily see Boeing going (much) higher, and I hope it does! But it‚Äôs not worth the stress at this point in my life. Maybe I‚Äôll buy shares, but mostly shifting most of this money into long term boglehead moves (boring). I did leave a couple bets on the table though. . TLDR: don‚Äôt gamble with money you‚Äôre not willing to lose. Know when to call it, win or lose. Good luck "

"I‚Äôve watched **$1.5 million in unrealized gains disappear since this post**. That‚Äôs not easy to stomach.

It was a belief in a therapy that could give kids more time‚Äîtime to breathe easier, to hold onto strength a little longer, to live a little fuller. Deramiocel isn‚Äôt just another drug on a spreadsheet. It‚Äôs a shot at preserving heart function in boys whose bodies are failing them far too young.. I respect the FDA‚Äôs role and the need for rigorous data. But celebrating this setback? Cheering the $CRL like it‚Äôs a win? Behind this company are scientists pouring their lives into something meaningful, and families holding onto the possibility of something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat could slow down the heartbreak.. So yes, I‚Äôm down big. But my pain is paper. The real pain is the one that‚Äôs been prolonged for parents watching their child fade without options.. **And that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm still long.**. Because I believe in the data. I believe in the team. I believe HOPE-3 will deliver what the FDA needs to see. And most of all‚ÄîI believe these families deserve a shot at a different ending.

OpenAI to release web browser in challenge to $GOOGL Chrome
This is great!! Perplexity is releasing one too. Google's lawyers who are defending $GOOGL breakup should write these guys a thank you letter! Maybe even send them a gift card.
"Doesn‚Äôt matter if this browser will be a success, but $GOOGL -10% confirmed"
Pretty bullish news for $GOOGL
"Here you go: . OpenAI is close to releasing an AI-powered web browser that will challenge Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), opens new tab market-dominating $GOOGL Chrome, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.. The browser is slated to launch in the coming weeks, three of the people said, and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse the web. It will give OpenAI more direct access to a cornerstone of Google's success. . If adopted by the 400 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI's browser could put pressure on a key component of rival Google's ad-money spigot. Chrome is an important pillar of Alphabet's ad business, which makes up nearly three-quarters of its revenue, as Chrome provides user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably, and also gives $GOOGL a way to route search traffic to its own engine by default.. OpenAI's browser is designed to keep some user interactions within a ChatGPT-like native chat interface instead of clicking through to websites, two of the sources said.. The browser is part of a broader strategy by OpenAI to weave its services across the personal and work lives of consumers, one of the sources said.. OpenAI declined to comment.. The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.. Led by entrepreneur Sam Altman, OpenAI upended the tech industry with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022. After its initial success, OpenAI has faced stiff competition from rivals including $GOOGL and startup Anthropic, and is looking for new areas of growth.. In May, OpenAI said it would enter the hardware domain, paying $6.5 billion to buy io, an AI devices startup from Apple's (AAPL.O), opens new tab former design chief, Jony Ive.. A web browser would allow OpenAI to directly integrate its AI agent products such as Operator into the browsing experience, enabling the browser to carry out tasks on behalf of the user, the people said.. The browser's access to a user‚Äôs web activity would make it the ideal platform for AI ""agents"" that can take actions on their behalf, like booking reservations or filling out forms, directly within the websites they use.. TOUGH COMPETITION. OpenAI has its work cut out - $GOOGL Chrome, which is used by more than 3 billion people, currently holds more than two-thirds of the worldwide browser market, according to web analytics firm StatCounter. Apple's (AAPL.O), opens new tab second-place Safari lags far behind with a 16% share. Last month, OpenAI said it had 3 million paying business users for ChatGPT.. Other AI startups like The Browser Company and Brave have announced AI-powered browsers capable of performing actions on a user's behalf this year. Perplexity, a well-funded startup known for its search engine, also launched its AI browser, Comet, on Wednesday.. Chrome's role in providing user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably has proven so successful that the Department of Justice has demanded its divestiture after a U.S. judge last year ruled that the $GOOGL parent holds an unlawful monopoly in online search.. OpenAI's browser is built atop Chromium, Google's own open-source browser code, two of the sources said. Chromium is the source code for $GOOGL Chrome, as well as many competing browsers including Microsoft's (MSFT.O), opens new tab Edge and Opera (OPRA.O), opens new tab.. Last year, OpenAI hired two longtime $GOOGL vice presidents who were part of the original team that developed $GOOGL Chrome. The Information was first to report their hires and that OpenAI previously considered building a browser.. An OpenAI executive testified in April that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if antitrust enforcers succeeded in forcing the sale.. $GOOGL has not offered Chrome for sale. The company has said it plans to appeal the ruling that it holds a monopoly.. OpenAI decided to build its own browser, rather than simply a ""plug-in"" on top of another company's browser, in order to have more control over the data it can collect, one source said."
"Challenge $GOOGL Chrome by using its very open source engine developed and maintained by $GOOGL (Chromium)? Can't make that shit up. If they actually manage to kill Chrome, are they going to newly sponsor maintenance of the Chromium project, the way $GOOGL does now for all the other free-riders (Edge, Opera, etc.)?"
$GOOGL is King.
$GOOGL to $165 atleast confirmed üìâ
"They will integrate gemini within a month in chrome, hands down $GOOGL has best distribution and they are going to come out winning even in this race"
$GOOGL is cooked
Honestly from a UI standpoint if all they do is build-out Chat-GPT and allow you to browse webpages from within it then I'll try it out. . Take the same app they have and add a browser seemlessly and they could change things. But it needs to be $AAPL levels of seemless and they need to talk with computer companies about being the new preinstalled default browser for business reasons.. ChatGPT use is really high. If they implement the browser well enough then people won't even notice.

I hate how many people keep posting $UNH calls because I keep buying shares
Should‚Äôve done 500 shares or ATM leaps for Jan2027 instead. I am extremely bullish on $UNH but idk about $540 a year from now.
Playing with $UNH while the Mangione trial plays itself out seems incredibly risky and dumb but that also probably means it will make this dude millions.
"I just want you to be sure you‚Äôre aware of the exposure here. This is 24,700 shares long $UNH at ~500.. that‚Äôs $10M. You‚Äôre ~100x leveraged. Why not a lower strike price‚Ä¶ maybe ~10x leveraged? I get the play, i want you to win, but this is a little too optimistic. A 50% run wouldn‚Äôt even net you a gain and that would beat 95% of stocks in the market.. I recommend $450 strikes."
$UNH has to go to over 540 to make him money?
Trying to learn options. So $UNH has to exceed $540 per share before July 2026 for this to be profitable?
Not touching $UNH till Jan 26. Still curious to see if client companies start leaving $UNH to go to other providers and if the investigations come up with anything.
"Can‚Äôt really go up until earnings clarity. If they were somehow double billing, $UNH gonna have a bad time."
So brave.  I bet you think $GOOGL is a hidden gem too.
I lost $1200 last month of $UNH calls. I still feel sick.
Should have bought $CLOV calls instead. Good luck
Don‚Äôt you think that $BB bill will have an effect on the future earnings? Good luck!
If you are convinced why not sell some naked puts on $UNH around $250 to finance the trade? Surely a bit riskier but the cash from the puts could reduce your cost to zero. A move to $400 would be very profitable if it happened this summer.
"$UNH will probably keep cutting and cutting their workforce in order to improve short term earnings.. But remember that things are still generally negative for $UNH. Increased scrutiny over their billing practices = less revenue over time. Poor reputation for denying services = less growth. Lack of comprehensive specialty care & hospitals = less growth potential; they will lose customers to systems that can provide the whole package. $EMR switch to epic = a short term decrease in quality and quantity of service, but will eventually improve in long run.. The only plus side is that they don‚Äôt own hospitals, so they‚Äôre not as effected by the medicaid cuts as their competitors."
"not a good week for $UNH, but I believe you"
There's no way lol. $490 $MAX
Literally seeing so many $UNH purchases on here and the stock tanked today lol. WTF guys?!?!?
"Yeah, I‚Äôm on the same thought process as you. I converted my whole $UNH position into leaps."
What you might be missing is $UNH will have to increase benefit payouts to prevent future lawsuits. This will erode earnings
I can assure you $UNH is going under and no providers are accepting their insurance anymore

"TO THE SO-CALLED ""MANAGEMENT"" OF ARBY'S,. It has come to my attention, and the attention of MANY, MANY PEOPLE, that the service provided by your establishment, specifically the Arby's near Mar a Lago is, frankly, A DISASTER.. Last night, I ordered a meal and it was delivered to me without the PROPER DIPPING SAUCE. This is an OUTRAGE. A TOTAL DISREGARD for the customer. The HORSEY SAUCE? It was GONE. Like so many jobs under previous administrations. This is UNACCEPTABLE! We have THE BEST SAUCES. People love them. They tell me, ""Sir, your sauces are the best."" And then Arby's forgets them! SAD!. And let's not even MENTION the napkins. ZERO. NONE. Not a single napkin in the bag. Do you know what that means? It means I was left with a mess. A HUGE, NASTY MESS. The LOWEST BAR. And Arby's, frankly, FAILED.. This is a clear example of your company's unwillingness to provide a RECIPROCAL and FAIR exchange for my HARD-EARNED MONEY. We pay GOOD MONEY for your food, and we expect GOOD SERVICE in return. NOT this KIND of service. This is a BAD DEAL. . If you continue with these policies of NEGLECT, this complete LACK OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL, then we will have NO $CHH but to reconsider our relationship. Believe me, we have options. MANY options. Other fast-food establishments, tremendous ones, are just waiting. They want our business. And they will provide the sauces. And the napkins. GUARANTEED.. You need to MAKE THIS RIGHT. IMMEDIATELY. Consider this a WARNING. The American people DESERVE better.. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER"

"After 4 long years of holding and building my position while selling calls and CSPs, it feels surreal to see so much more positive sentiment for $SOFI. FINALLY. Execution has been consistently solid by the management team, but it‚Äôs just not had the love like other stocks. I fully accept there‚Äôs been plenty of potential opportunity cost by holding this position, but IDGAF. This is just the stock that I believed and it is what it is. Zero intention of taking profits, and will continue selling CCs and using the income to buy more. "

"Southeast Asian Super App like Uber and $AAPL Pay had a lil Vietnamese hyper-baby.. Currently the market leader in transport and deliveries and a growing payment service we can see big growth over the next few years.. I visited Vietnam in late last year and as soon as I landed, everyone told me this is the app to get. All the locals, all the expats, especially all the tourists get this app as soon as they land and they use it for everything. Food, transport, payments, it is a massive, massive app. And looking at the tourism data over the past year earnings should be strong.. In Q1 2025, the number of foreign visitors to Vietnam surged by approximately 30% year-on-year, reaching more than 6 million arrivals, the strongest quarterly performance to date.. This will directly affect GRAB‚Äôs bottom line. Earnings are due end of the month and we can see a huge stock surge if we get a surprise based of of the increased tourism money. Tourists spend much more than the locals do leading to big revenue gains for GRAB. They are all using GRAB to get around and get their noodles delivered to their Airbnbs‚Ä¶.

Only upvoting because I see $UNH.
"Good luck. I don‚Äôt love this play because $UNH on the payer side is just a top target by a lot of people. Paying pass through fees to $UNH is becoming a problem, and the lawsuits about shorting benefits as well. I think $UNH will have to increase payout approvals to avoid lawsuits and also clients may choose alternative companies. It looks attractive because of the rapid drop but I worry there are fundamental drivers for it that became apparent"
"I think $UNH is a bad move, I believe if it was inside out good company, after the huge fall after the DOJ probe... the price would have easily recovered. . For $GOOGL, I am very very very bullish on this.. "

". Here's a shrek emoji instead of a wall of text. DD for anyone interested in learning more: [. still holding, price target is $43. see you tomorrow.. Update:  . Follow my portfolio in real time on AfterHour¬†[. Since updating that I'm holding via screenshots is getting old, I linked my portfolio to afterhour. You can follow my position in real time and verify that it's real. Nothing to hide, basically just buy shares and hold, not trying to dump (don't think my size is significant enough to cause a dump anyways).¬†I genuinely believe the stock is undervalued. As of 7/9/2025, the closing price is $4.05 and market cap is $913M. That's still a wildly low and undervalued market cap for $SANA given the market opportunity and the success/significance of their human and preclinical data."
"Why would someone buy this over $CRSP, who is also working on a T1D cure? $SANA straight up doesn't have enough money to bring this to market even if it works 100%. They're going to have to dilute massively in the next 6 months or so, just to keep the lights on."
I hopped on the $SANA train. No inmunosupresor cure for Type 1 diabetes. Strong executive team. $JPM targets at $12. üöà
"Glad to see some $SANA representation here. I‚Äôm an OG, been buying since shortly after the IPO. Been a brutal run but I‚Äôve averaged all the way down to $6. Holding this one to the grave strictly out of principle and blind belief. Lots of upside potential."

$PROK squeezing
"$CAVA is the new chipotle, and I‚Äôm willing to bet on it. Just back from vacation and heading to the street in a month, which means this is my last month of pure freedom before I‚Äôm shackled to institutional trading restrictions, brooks brothers suits, and long term delta one strategies.. FWIW, being a wsb degen is more fun than most institutional roles. I wonder how long before I blow up this billion dollar hedge fund by leveraging them to the tits."
$CAVA 18k gains
Chipotle needs to seriously turn around the hate they‚Äôre receiving or $CAVA is gonna gobble up their market share. Smaller portions & triple the price = everyone I know including myself went from going frequently to every once in a while
"I'm slowly loading up on $CAVA, hope it does something!"
"I disagree on the cmg comparison. I went to Cava for the first time as a try the food before I buy the stock and everything was like $20 or close to it. I walked out and that ended my thoughts on the stock. For background, I make 6 figures and still thought it was expensive. Meanwhile, chicken bowl still cost around $11 at Chipotle. I'm also the guy that didn't buy the $CMGO ecoli dip a decade ago so I'm probably wrong."
$CAVA is not the new chipotle. The fast casual ‚Äòlunch bowl‚Äô market is the next micro-brewery market. It has become oversaturated and middle class consumer spending is slowing. I work a half mile from the original $CAVA and have never been once when there‚Äôs better lunch options like Moby Dick/ Mezah/ Naz‚Äôs Halaal. Don‚Äôt get me started on ‚ÄòAnd Shawarma‚Äô ü§§ü§§ü§§  My next chipotle stock is Potbelly since it‚Äôs also in plans to expand from 400 to 2000 shops nationwide and their ‚ÄòPotbelly Perks‚Äô rewards and mobile app is better than what Chipotle offers

"Feeling great about this entry point for $CAVA. Fast growing, 400+ locations, opening 60 more this year, 1,000 locations by 2032, and every $CAVA I‚Äôve ever been in is packed! Excellent income statement and balance sheet trends. It hasn‚Äôt participated in the recent rally, but it appears to be putting in a bottom and recently there was some bullish options activity from bigger players. Thinking about buying some long dated calls as well at about $100 strike."
$CAVA 2x play
**Seems like you‚Äôre really bullish on $CAVA With that many locations and how packed they are it‚Äôs definitely appealing Buying calls sounds like a smart move  just gotta hold and wait for it to take off long-term**

My hero. $PLTR üöÄ
Theta going to eat this away like no other if $PLTR does not pump after it already pumped
All in on $PLTR calls? That‚Äôs either giga-brain or pure insanity. I‚Äôm here for it. üöÄ
It was between $140 $PLTR 7/11 calls or $SMCI $50 calls and I went with the wrong one go figure.
!remindme 2 weeks $PLTR $165 is regarded
Gone full regard on $BBAI hype. YOLO wish me luck
$BBAI is one crony contract away from greatness there are worse bets out there.
$BBAI to your money üòÇ (sorry couldn't resist)
"$BBAI has shown some strength the last few sessions, including today."
$BBAI sell signal confirmed. Thanks OP.. Ill jump back in at around $4 a piece
$BBAI to the moon or my therapist‚Äôs next client. Let‚Äôs gooooo!
I did the same with Cadence (17k) and $UNH (3k). Market only goes up?
" I bought in at 6.5. . I have a collar on my $BBAI position (max downside 7.5 per share max upside 10 per share). I‚Äôll be rolling my collar if it continues moving up. And if it tanks, I‚Äôll re-enter after it stabilizes."
"3mo returns look like this for a lot of companies, including $NVDA"
Will $ABAT be next multi bagger? Or ampx and a at in the different fields?
"IM BULLISH ON COST, $WMT, and $AMZN"
$RKLB üöÄ
"So let me get this straight, I sold $SOFI at $14.00 and $NVDA at $137 to full port into a once in a lifetime opportunity with $UNH and this is what I have to show for it after a month and a week? +3.14%? Jesus Christ!"
up 37k on $RKLB today!
Sir Peter Beck built a strong one. $RKLB üöÄ
You bought $TSLA puts after a $20 drop? ü§Æ
"Guys! I got 2 interview invitations for internship today! . One is British Columbia Investment  and the second one is $SNX Bank. . If I get offer from both, then which one should I go for? üòã"
How to become exit liquidity.. Step 1: Buy $WOLF.. Step 2: Hold overnight . Congratulations! You have became exit liquidity
$RKLB almost 700% gains in 1Y. but i chose $LUNR instead üò≠üò≠üíÄüíÄ
"While the market was busy crashing, $CRCL jerk gang was having the best goon session."
$TSLA is still up 33% the past 3 months on literally nothing but bad news and a distracted CEO. Plenty of dump left.
">TESLA CHINA SOLD 71,599 VEHICLES IN JUNE(+0.8%Y/Y),   . $BYDIF SOLD 377,628 VEHICLES, +11 % Y/Y  . $TSLA CHINA EXPORTED 10,115 VEHICLES(-13.8%Y/Y)  . AND $BYDIF 85,957 (+218%Y/Y). Bro trust me Tesla doing so well in GYNA. /s"
"Next $TSLA pump, going deep into puts for August. Next earnings is a drop."
Bloomberg is fkin ruthless with their interviews lmao they‚Äôll bring someone on to talk tariffs or whatever and then cut them off mid-sentence like I HAVE TO STOP YOU THERE WE JUST GOT MANUFACTURING $PMI FOR AFGHANISTAN HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL AFFECT THE AFGHAN 2 YEAR BOND
$TSLA is a political party that makes overpriced cars.
It‚Äôs pretty perverse how you can get a literal YouTube ad of 30 minutes of political propaganda. How much do these advertising Goebbels propagandists even pay $GOOGL for this stuff
Oh fuck... my $CLBR calls..... are green
$NVDA 160 COME ON
Dave Portnoy bought $10M worth of $TSLA shares. $TSLA to 100 confirmed
$CLBR seems immune to tariffs news. . Show em your GREEN BIG D $CLBR
$UNH YOU COCKSUCKER ü§¨
$RKLB was less than $5 this time last year. LOL
Name a more iconic duo than $TSLA and retail pumping its price in afterhours.
$UNH finna be bout tree-fiddy soon.
Mah boy $RKLB bringing the dough!!!
I would like to wake up tomorrow to $GOOGL being at 180. One can dream.
"today was somewhat irksome in that while my $RKLB, which I hold but hate, and my $OKLO, which I hold but don't care about, both increased in value, my precious $IREN did a bunch of weird annoying shit and my beloved $NBIS $GLXY duo got their dicks stomped deeply in mud"
$TSLA too high
Muskolini gonna get all fuk up on horse tranquilizer one night and start calling someone a Pedo.. $TSLA gonna drill.
have never bought $TSLA before. Will I regret these calls
I‚Äôm thinking of buying $BBAI cause I hate feeling left out. Reminds me of middle school ;(. wtf is this shit. I‚Äôm kinda retarded
You? Bitching when $AMZN takes too long to deliver. Crying when the UberEats driver's delayed 20 minutes with your Chipotle.  . Bitch I used to wait days for a single song to download on Napster.  . **We are not the same.**
$RDDT
"$RKLB held up my port today, not sure if that's good or bad"
"$GOOGL opens at 172 tomorrow, $AMD goes to 145 tomorrow, WOLF bears in disbelief when it hits 3 tomorrow. No one is happy, except for the people who paradoxically made money while being regarded and shouting ""told you so"" -- you'll feel so out of touch with reality that you consider buying crystals and changing your name because of the 10 minutes you spent reading about numerology.. I leave this question with you: what product would you buy if it was endorsed by Pedro Pascal?"
Damn my $UVIX calls might print
Oh boy am I glad I moved 50% of my port over to $RKLB last december. (Its still a small number)
Looking to open a savings account with 0.38% interest so I will buy $GOOGL shares instead
"Damn, $PLTR used to be a penny stock üò±"
Yall tryna play catch up when there‚Äôs enough companies to invest in like $CLF
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ ppl who buy put when market make new ath ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ you should short $BTC also
$TSLA PUTS. Oh Lord. Catch me if I fall.
We can bury him next to the guy who bought $GOOGL puts the day it was down 9% and said ‚Äúthe sell-off is just getting started‚Äù
Premiums on the weeklies are jacked. Was waiting for a good opportunity to buy in puts but kept seeing strong support at 290 and especially at 270. I think $TSLA starts to rip back to 320 from here. Take this with a grain of salt $TSLA is so hard to predict lmao. Best of luck though!
"I am not a $TSLA fan, but premarket is not lookin good for you bro. However, anything can happen, good luck!"
Noooo not $TSLA. It never makes any sense.
"I am an owner of $TSLQ and that printed today. I think there's more room to run, but I'm probably taking some gains... I agree long term that $TSLA falls. The next earnings call in a few weeks will be fascinating."
"Almost looks like $TSLA is gonna bounce between 285 and 320, just give it 2-3 weeks and you should be gucci"
Big fan of $TSLA
"This is my third and final attempt at a DD. My first two got taken down by the mods. Give me a chance. We all now know that the Big Beautiful Bill BBB just got passed, and it brings big changes to how gambling losses are taxed.. Beginning in 2026, gamblers can only deduct 90% of their losses, meaning even a break-even or losing gambler could owe taxes!!!!!!. I personally believe this will tank professional gambling and it‚Äôs about to send gambling stocks (DKNG, $PENN, $MGM, $CZR, RSI, etc.) into a nosedive.. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. New Gambling Tax Rule. Old Rule - You could fully offset gambling winnings with gambling losses. Win $100K, lose $100K? $0 taxable.. New Rule - You can only deduct 90% of gambling losses.. If you win $100K and then proceed to immediately Yolo it onto red and lose $100K. You‚Äôre still taxed as if you won $10K.. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. Consequences. Many professional gamblers will step away from the sport along with many average people like us who win very little or even lose.. Yeah, this is fucked and I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt see more people talking about it.. Side note: I still believe people will want to gamble to scratch that itch. They will just end up doing it offshore using cryptos and or buying stock options like us degens.. I will be taking out margin Monday to buy puts and will post on Monday at open my portfolio. Play Puts. $DKNG $40 7/25/25 $ 1.21. $DKNG $42 1/16/26  $5.43. $DKNG $40 11/21/25 $3.88. "
People gamble because they are addicted. They don't care about taxes.. $FLUT and $DKNG long leaps.
Hope this hits and $DKNG eats the curb
Not significant enough a change or a change that‚Äôs happening immediately to have an material impact on the stock price near term. You‚Äôre going to get smoked. Get out and wait for an entry to go long on some $LPTX puts and be happy with the double digit gains.
If so then $HOOD should be the hardest one hit. Because that‚Äôs all it is.
"I‚Äôm actually long $DKNG puts as well. . I‚Äôll be solely using Bovada (offshore) or Robinhood (Event Driven Sports). . It‚Äôs not hard to bet $50K to $100K in notional a year. . I‚Äôve had many break even years, and now I‚Äôll have upwards of an extra $10K in taxable income?. Nah I‚Äôm good."

Market is roaring into safety stocks like $CVNA
"Bought 2000 shares of $AMD this morning into a near instant $1500 loss. Rode the ride back up and exited for a $770 profit.. Bought 2000 shares of $UAL right before the tariff news hit, instantly down $2200. Rode the ride back up and exited for a $110 profit.. $880 total profit and it only cost me 2-3 years of my life expectancy."
"I've gone full blown stupid now, I bought $CLBR"
So fun owning $UNH and $GLD leaps and never making any money on them #blessed üôè
*The first batch of tariff letters has been sent today.

Market rotation from speculative meme stocks like $TSLA into quality insolvencies like WOLF
We getting the suicide hotline gonna get posted for the $TSLA bulls?
$RKLB continues to shine on.
Still impressed that $TSLA is only down 7% after Elons performance ... The amount of passes this guy gets is crazy.
Mango Jr. $CLBR podcast tonight. Let the grift begin!!
"$TSLA corruption trade is finished, there is literally 0 catalysts now; going long would be going full retard"

"Instead of dumping bonds, I guess the Japanese are dumping their $CLBR shares. "
$BULL trading at 13$ premarket and y'all be acting like its price has collapsed. 10 days ago it was below 10.50 for god's fucking sake zoom out
Some of you here don't own $CLBR shares and it shows
I don't think people really understand how bad this can get for $TSLA. A personal beef with ü•≠!? That man cancels funding for any organization that inconveniences him and is the most vindictive thing to walk this earth. $TSLA could be targeted by the prez! Enjoy justifying the P/E ratio now..
Sold my $TSLA puts because I have paper hands. Go make me regret it $TSLA bears
Made 2k on $TSLA puts. Done for day üòé. Sold and I'll get calls now üòÖü§∑üèø‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

And $CLBR is gonna finish the day +4% haha so many ppl were cheering when it went down
$TSLA WILL BE KNOWN AS THE MOST CORRUPTED AND MANIPULATED STOCK IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER
now watch this $GOOGL Drive
"Honestly thought $TSLA would have dumped harder at open, are we going to close green today"
There are YouTubers that have made an entire personality out of owning $TSLA stock.
"I‚Äôm stupid so all I see is dip buying opportunity on SPY, $TSLA, $HOOD. Selling puts."
$RKLB pumps so hard when Elon shits the bed LMAO
"Russian minister dismissed under suspicion of embezzlement, found dead in his car of 'apparent suicide', gunshot to the head. His weapon was found in a storm drain, where he threw it after dying from his wounds.. $TSLA 250p"

When is $LUNR crashing some shit on the moon again?
"Imagine being a $TSLA investor who held on to shares after melon begged everyone not to sell, only for the prick to go around and start a flame war with the prez"
I just bought some $GOOGL. The only company with actual robotaxis. Elmo is fucked
$TSLA Bulls in denial that they have been turned into long term bagholders
That second $WOLF pump was not in my bingo card
"If you don‚Äôt start to pump $GOOGL, I will be using Bing from now on"
i should have just bought and hold $PLTR instead of fucking around with options
"Holy shit I am getting killed today. -10k, so far.. Shouldn't have sold my 1000 $RKLB shares."
Which one of you regards said $CLBR was going to 20?? Come out here I just wanna shake your hand
"$TSLA stock taking a fat shit is an infinite money glitch, every single time it dumps, it‚Äôs bought up within 24 hours"
$TSLA bros microwave salmon in the office lunchroom

BULL rugged. $UNH rugged. $CLBR literally singlehandedly carrying my port rn
"welp i guess $TSLA bears win, that 2nd Epstein tweet probably aint gonna make the stock go up now, Elon saved your puts"
$BULL
$TSLA down to $50
Thinking about getting back into $TSLA puts 5 minutes after I sold tbh
"should have known $GOOGL will dump, far too many posts on wsb about being bullish on $GOOGL"
"I bought SPX puts.  I  bought SPX calls.  both are deep red.. In fact, the only sensible thing I did was buy $CVNA calls.  Only green in my portfolio."
i somehow sold the top on $AAPL this morning thank the lord i think im done for the day made $80.
Who's still winning on $RKLB because it's most of their port?
"We're back in it. Im glad i didn't hold over the long weekend, but we are back. Nearly $30K $MSTR YOLO into earnings. #LET'S GO.  . *Not gonna go through my reasoning again. If you know you know. If not, go look through my last post here.*"
$MSTR YOLO x2
$MSTR earnings are 100% meaningless
"Damn bro, and I wanted to short $MSTR at 400 lol (didn't pull the trigger)"
People who keep calling this a ‚Äúponzi‚Äù are the same people that would call Bitcoin a scam lol. Personally I think $MSTR will go a lot higher than $500.
$MSTR options are a scam. Even when you're right your ass will still get fucked. Unless you're buying after it being way down
I have a big put on $MSTR. We gonna have some fun together ü§£
FUCK EVERY HATER. $MSTR TO 600
Wow! I think $UPXI is the next $MSTR. 
$AAPL can only go up from here
"$AAPL always goes up heading in to earnings and then regardless of what happens, it drops like $5-$10 right after."
"this could be interesting to see, as I myself currently divest and shift away from $AAPL. good luck üëç¬†"
"Just opened Robinhood, threw my rent on $AAPL calls too. If we go down, at least we go down together."
"If $AAPL goes down, I‚Äôm switching to Android out of spite. Diamond hands only."
Yeah $AAPL is bullish
$AAPL will go up at the first crumb of good news about their ai. It won‚Äôt take much. . But they certainly have taken some big hits right to the face lately  for sure
Nice one dude! $AAPL is down
I have shares. $AAPL has been lagging the rest of the mag 7.. safe haven too in case the market goes maomao because of tariffs.
So many $AAPL bears in here reinforcing my belief that this is definitely going up.  I have quite a few $AAPL leaps and I am feeling pretty confident in them.
"I‚Äôve seen $AAPL ‚Äòonly go up‚Äô since the iPod days. Careful, those green lines don‚Äôt last forever."
So my $TSLA calls are saved?
"Just bet on another delay, should have done that for every ""deadline"" they set since Feb, would have made more on that than $TSLA puts."
$NIO OPTIONS
"**109 buys on the $17 call? Someone really wants $NIOIF to moon or go broke, no in-between.**¬†"
"I don't get it. So you're confident it gets to $15+ by January 2026 but only to $7+ by January 2027. But ok maybe you bought them at different times.. I am bullish on $NIOIF and have LEAPS and shares but I don't think it will hit $15-20 range by January, not that soon. That said, I would so want to be wrong on this."
Based on... what? What makes you believe $NIOIF (a company that only loses money and has been losing more money each passing quarter) is going to roll past $20?
"$NIOIF is a shit ass, you really had to pick the dead horse huh?"
Why are you so confident in $NIOIF in particular? Give us a short summary
I have shares in $NIOIF which I bought at an average of 10$. The price action is pretty frustrating and has been only downwards for many years now
"In my experience, people investing in $NIOIF are never fans of the cars. They usually just fall for NIOs tech propaganda.. NIOs are unpopular and brands like $XPNGF and $BYDIF with Xiaomi coming up are much better cars (granted $XPNGF and Xiaomi just stole the inside from Tesla)."
I hopes this happens. I have been waiting for months to get rid of all $NIOIF shares. All it need is to get up around $7 and Im happy to sell all of this shit.
"I bought $1000 worth of shares on $NIOIF a few months back, and I feel like an idiot.. The degeneracy on display here is next level."
$NIOIF needs to be on 60 minutes again like last time¬†
dang I didn't know I could be writing $NIOIF calls to 20 year olds with dad's money
Why are you betting against ‚ÄòMERICA? Buy some $INTC like a true patriot
"$NIOIF is in a big crisis this year, I have a small position, but keep monitoring the status"
"Rookie numbers, bro.  I was down over $71K from the failed mission this year.  Luckily, I was playing with the house's money from last year's $LUNR gains (over $250K).  It still stings.. This one will move again this year.  I'm going to try to make it all back on $LUNR alone.. "
Might as well gamble with $BULL
"I just bought a bunch of $LUNR calls expiring in september, maybe it will take off now. im praying."
. $JOBY-WT is a leader in eVTOL. Buy the best and YOLO.

"holy shit, $TSLA just opened down 22% in the East Zimbabwe premarket. bulls are fucked"

You‚Äôre going to regret selling $TSLA once they announce the Tesla Sex Bot Optipuss with AI
$TSLA -20% tomorrow
Elon really couldn‚Äôt have launched this before the holiday last week? My $TSLA puts got cooked and expired üòñ
"Maybe in the end it was about the money we lost along the way. In my case, $75K on $TSLA poots in 2021. üíÖ"
I'd rather fly economy and use instead the $2000 more I would have spent in business to buy 0 $DTG. . creates anticipation during the flight.
"It might seem rational and logical to short $TSLA, but remember the stock is anything but rational.¬†"
When TACO inevitably tweets back at Elon it will probably send $TSLA down another 5%
$TSLA 300p gonna print!!!
Elon has been shorting $TSLA at $488
"On futes that are open after tariff delay announcement.. Futes Green:. * DAX. * $CAC. * FTSE. * Euro Stoxx. * $ASX. * $MSCI. Futes Fuk:. * US. Futes Confused:. * Nikkei. The money is leaving Mango, what are you doing you big orange oompa loompa, The money doesn't like this fuckin instability."

Calls on $TSLA because sometimes you just gotta do the craziest thing to out crazy the obvious
"There are so many commercials for medication for eczema.   I feel like not a huge percentage of people suffer from eczema, and those who do most likely are already prescribed medicine to treat it.   Really odd to pay all that money for the ad time for all of us to have to watch the commercials.   The logical conclusion is that the margins are quite high treating eczema.   The margins are most likely huge for all cream medication as the COGS can be tiny, factoring mass production.  - Anyway, $TSLA 200 -"
$AMD to 170 in the next two weeks. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

"I'm long $HOOD and get the hate they get. But I keep getting comments that totally misunderstand the issue with OpenAI objecting to tokenizing their shares. It was a bit cheesy but if you are at all serious, do take a look at the announcement video in Cannes. Vlad actually did a great summary on a chalkboard about how this all works.. \- Tokens are backed by real assets. In OpenAI case, it's the SPV shares owned by Robinhood. RH maintains custody. It's basically a promise to sell the shares to the token owner when public.. \- This is only in the EU. Mainly because in the US, we have stricter ""accredited investor"" rules. In fact, this even applies to you today and forbids non-accredited investors from participating in these sorts of private offerings. It's really a space for the wealthy. One side is ""but we have to protect retail (dumb) investors."" and the other side is ""retail investors are smart and understand the risks or at least free to make their own choices."". \- The SpaceX and OpenAI tokens were given as a promo gift and can't be traded. It was more of a representation of tokenizing private shares. It was 5 minutes of the hour long announcement but 99% of the post announce discussion.. \- It was amazing how quickly they did this and stock/etf token trading is available now.. \- Perpetual futures will be here in a couple months as well which is huge. Typical of RH, the UX is fantastic and intuitive.. \- People are also glossing over the fact that they were pretty much Crypto only in Italy, Spain, Lithuania, Poland. US & UK have brokerage. NOW, they just **released in ALL 31 EU/EEA countries**. . \- They launched tokenization of assets which is huge. People that don't understand think tokens are just made up out of thin air. They are not. They are backed by the real asset and just make transacting more seamless. In fact, phase 2 in a couple months will allow 24/7 trading of tokenized assets. Then phase 3 also in a couple months, you can actually custody your own tokens on your own wallets, swap, etc. They are starting with stocks/etf's. The openai/spacex was an example of something a little different (private shares). They also mentioned real estate and art. Again... any unique asset can be tokenized. I hear stuff like, ""well, what if they tokenize my house?"" Sure, if they owned your house. Again, they own the private shares of OpenAI/SpaceX. They basically took $1M worth of their owned tokens and distributed it as a promo for signup. Sure did create a lot of FUD though.. Bigger picture is that tokenization of real assets has tremendous potential even beyond stocks. Launch in all EU countries so quickly is a major growth factor. New capabilities like perpetual futures and 24/7 trading are in very high demand. Yes, RH pushes boundaries but they are also large enough to know how to work within regulations. btw... in interviews at Cannes, also talked about how supportive the new SEC was and they have a seat at the table. I feel tokenization of assets is here to stay and will be expanded to the US this year. (just my opinion). . "
$HOOD and all the OpenAI FUD
"Love all the hate and bears coming out of the woodwork for $HOOD, chart still looks amazing for a move significantly higher and that's all I care about. . People were bearish and hated $PLTR at $60, $80, $100 etc and they're back to being quiet now lol."
This is terrible and you'll lose a fortune sooner or later if you are this loyal to $HOOD
$HOOD to the moon real soon
"Tokenizing shares is basically acting as a bookie on the price direction of shares.  Anyone can do that.  I can do that, which is to ""be the house"" and make a market in something I don't own.  Like taking bets on next Sunday's football game score.  That is nothing at all like owning the actual shares, though for day trading and casino-mentality it probably doesn't matter.  This is not much different than the mortgage security game played before the market crash in 2008.  Trade securities based on options in a security that isn't owned.  Third derivative. Roll the Dice.. Why not offer a tokenized Bitcoin?  BTC's main attraction is its limited number of potential coins (21M) based on its algorithm which makes each successive coin harder to ""mine"".  But any financial company could offer tokens against Bitcoin and increase its availability infinitely.  So what is unlimited Bitcoin worth?  Zero.  This is the way to destroy any equity valuation above its asset (book) value.  Sell tokens and it takes away the scarcity value of any equity.  This is why OpenAI (Sam Altman) is fighting $HOOD against tokenizing its own stock.  This is a very bad idea for markets."
"""It's basically a promise to sell the shares to the token owner when public."". Is it, though? It would make some kind of sense if it was that, but so far I haven't seen terms or a contract statement that says that, just general language that the value of the token ""follows"" the value of the asset in some unstated way. An SPV is mentioned, but not what it actually does. If the shares are never made available to the public, does $HOOD promise to buy the tokens back? At what price?. Maybe this is all written down somewhere in detail and legally binding and all, and I just haven't found it. I would love a URL!"
$APP & $INOD
"Added a bit more today.. From a technical perspective - $APP chart is conflicting. Either H&S or large Cup and Handle‚Ä¶.I would argue cup and handle with strong fundamentals.. $INOD looks like it wants to break through $52. A good quarter and we‚Äôll have lift off. Sizing it smaller given the risk associated with it. If $INOD prints a good quarter and forecast well, will lean into it after earnings and into the rest of the year."
"Most investors don't know what lies ahead for $ACHR because they are seriously lacking when it comes to doing their own DD: imagine a company that costs $10, has Palantir, Stellantis and Anduril as partners and is not only in the air cab business, but also in the military business.. # How do I know the time has come?. Because behind all the marketing, the truth is that their agreements with Palantir and Anduril are top secret, but they have been dropping several hints along the way:. * In the video Archer uploaded celebrating the 4th of July, they used an N703AX aircraft model, and one of these models was recently sold in 2025, I suspect to Anduril or the US army.. * Think about it: why use precisely this model in the video on the Independence Day of the United States?. * On July 4, the big beautiful bill was officially signed, which means that Palantir and Archer now have a free hand to build together the AI Foundation for the Future of Next-Gen Aviation Technologies.. * On June 26, 2025, Sean Duffy said the signing of the big beautiful bill is the first step in building A Brand-New Air Traffic Control System.. * Additionally, Archer has reiterated countless times that they plan to begin commercial operations by the end of 2025, and just a couple of days ago they moved one of their aircraft to Abu Dhabi and flew it for the first time to test it in extreme humidity and temperature conditions.. * To top it off, on June 6, 2025 Trump signed an executive order to incentivize drone production in the United States, mentioning eVTOLs in several of its sections as the protagonists of ‚ÄúAmerican dominance in the sector.‚Äù. I was the one who wrote the original DD when Archer was around $3, everyone at WSB laughed at me, and I have a suspicion that history is going to repeat itself once again.. My position:. "
The time of $ACHR has come
"The stellantis investment, might be overrated. The Boeing investment might be underrated. They are a massive defense contractor as well as the largest US exporter. . They could be looking at a future buyout, depending on how the military and civilian applications pan out. . Commercial air taxi and service to an entire metro area. Smaller more frequent flights.. Military, current weight capacity of a 4 person flight is maybe 1,000 lbs. that‚Äôs a 4 person spec ops team. It could also be configured in multiple formats with weapons systems.. Also $ARKB capital just took a position as well, about a month ago. The financial press love Cathie Wood. That might help as a pump to the stock price.. I‚Äôm long $ACHR. 3,000 shares"
"question from someone who doesn‚Äôt know anything about eVTOL: . - what makes $JOBY-WT less attractive . - why is their excessive advertising (olympics, Jimmy Fallon, Usher) not a red flag . - and unclear changes to the aircraft‚Äôs propellers/equipment . can you clear these up for me?"
"The aircraft that they ‚Äúflew‚Äù in Abu Dhabi is the one they only made hover for a minute and never actually flew in any way, right?. Isn‚Äôt that also the old model they rushed over to ‚Äútest‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt actually have any current models ready to fly? Can‚Äôt have $JOBY-WT stealing all their Middle East thunder. Have to do something to stay in the spotlight. . I‚Äôm too lazy to check on a Sunday but are you the one who‚Äôs been pumping $ACHR every weekend on r/stocks or are there just multiple pumpers who make a post every weekend trying to get people to buy? And why is it always ACHR? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a single $JOBY-WT pumper despite them being the better positioned company"
"Puffed up, speculative (at best) company. At least $JOBY-WT has something to show for it. With that said, calls."
"When you‚Äôre so dumb even your chat gpt slop has little to go off of üíÄ . That being said, I like $ACHR but they have a long way to go"
"This is regarded. $ACHR is only investable when they‚Äôve brought price per mile down to land travel. Until then, you‚Äôre lighting your money on fire via dilution into a bottomless pit.. If you need any more reasons to not buy this, Cathie buys $ACHR. üòÇ"
Buyer beware. Op is a mod of $ACHR and bans anyone in that group that dares to question the status quo.. 
"I don't know what is about $ACHR but there are consistent posts from few accounts trying to push narratives about it, also, if you post in the $ACHR some rational argument that the stock shouldn't x20 in a month they just ban you.. I am not sure if the evtols they have will fly but people there are super high regardless.. Might be a good short play if Grump tries to grift infrastructure and says evtols are the new thing."
$JOBY-WT will far outperform $ACHR
"Archer should be seen as a PLATFORM for advanced air mobility, a company capable of attracting funding from American institutions to create an American leader capable of acquiring all others, including drones. All managed by applications developed jointly with $PLTR. Joby has become too Japanese due to its dependence on Toyota."
$PLTR owns 19.9% of Surf Air Mobility as of last month. There's allot of overlap in the software side of things which is the scalable part.  So If I'm investing in things that are meme stock adjacent I'd probably pick Surf Air Mobility
My port is 95% $ACHR and I've had free shares since 5.70. $ACHR retire me
"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE. $ACHR-WT fakes are trying super hard to sell their shit üí© to retail.. Archer is going bankrupt by 2027 as they don‚Äôt have product. What they have is hype, PR, marketing, dreams but no execution.. Even regards should stay away from this."
"Friends- leave Archer for Joby. I‚Äôm not in Archer and heavy on Joby but keep watching both closely just not become blind follower of Joby.. This is more of same from Archer.. At this time I have concluded that Archer is ONLY interested in dick contest with Joby and trying very hard to stay relevant through PR, flashy update.. Sad‚Ä¶ we need real players n competition but seems eVTOL is becoming one horse race in USA.  Maybe Beta will join when they ready to transition from wing borne to vertical takeoff.. Friends I keep saying this whenever I see Archer getting hyped‚Ä¶. They are mostly style over substance.. PR over progress.. Promises over delivery.. Misleading vs Factual. Etc.. They don‚Äôt have certifiable product. They has one prototype which is has been exploited as showpiece than actual testing‚Ä¶.and their second prototype is having major design changes than first one‚Ä¶. They product is too heavy and cannot $VTOL so now they showing hat as CTOL.. Lastly for what it matters Cathie/Ark has invested here and this is also recommended by Jim Cramer!!. This cult has setup separate sub r/ACHR where if you asked question they ban you."
"I think Joby will beat $ACHR, but military applications sounds cool"
"When I last posted the day before the Robotaxi ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù that featured only 10-20 vehicles, supervised drivers in the passenger seat and teleoperators on standby, I listed a bunch of reasons why I felt $TSLA would drop in the ‚Äúnext few weeks‚Äù:. Although I didn‚Äôt foresee the absolutely regarded retail pump the day after the launch, I did what anyone with balls should do:. I increased my position even more.  My $60K put position is now a nearly $72K put position.  I cashed out of my July puts and loaded up on August puts.. Why did I do this?  One of my catalysts was that Elon would antagonize TACO again.  This has played out exactly as I expected and then some.  An ‚ÄúAmerica Party‚Äù now means Elon is TACO‚Äôs enemy.  This is insanely bad for all of Elon‚Äôs companies, from $TSLA to SpaceX to X.ai and everything else.. Now that Elon has gone nuclear, not only will equity values of all his companies plummet, but Elon will likely have to sell more $TSLA shares to fund his new political party.. I expect a big payoff for my August puts now that $TSLA is without any meaningful positive catalysts until after earnings on July 23 (at least).. Between now and then, more and more people will realize:. 1.  How devastating the Big Beautiful Bill will be to TSLA‚Äôs 2026 cashflows with the $7,500 EV tax credit expiring and the seemingly instant death of regulatory credit sales.  $TSLA may lose money on a $FCF basis as early as next quarter but almost certainly in 2026.. 2.  Elon and TACO are both loose cannons and can pop off at the mouth over a hurt ego at any moment.  Tweets trigger the algos.  THIS WILL BE A CONSTANT OVERHANG FOR $TSLA GOING $FORD.  Momentum will be very difficult to ignite now that Elon has pissed off most of America.. 3.  The true launch of Robotaxi with no teleoperators/supervised drivers will take MUCH longer than most of the Cult followers think.  Each state (including TX) will have different bars for $TSLA to clear in order to operate at scale.  Those bars just got higher with Elon starting The America Party.  Given that $TSLA is only a Level 2 ADAS technology, there‚Äôs a lot of trial and error before they can operate at scale.  One accident and ensuing bad PR, will send the stock plummeting.. 4.  Optimus won‚Äôt be a popular product (if ever) until $TSLA can have the robots operating at much more human levels (movement, comprehension, performative actions, etc.).  The Asians are way ahead on robot technology, the same way they are now way ahead on EV manufacturing/quality.. For all those that say ‚Äúbelieve it or not, just buy calls‚Äù, $TSLA is now down ~17% YTD.  The S&P 500 is up 7% and even the pathetic Russell 2000 is up ~1% YTD.. So please, by all means, keep telling me I‚Äôm stupid and that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing.   Keep buying your calls even though deep down you know you are just burning your money due to the fact you are in a CULT.. I‚Äôll keep shorting every nonsensical rally that you regards trigger as $TSLA continues its overall downward trend back towards 150-200.. "
$60K on $TSLA Puts‚Ä¶Upped it to $72K
Hell yea - with you with my July and August puts. Dip started Friday and $TSLA will tank next week.
Great move!! I also have been buying puts on $TSLA and cashing in. I don‚Äôt hold my positions multiple days which is just my preference I sell once I have 10-15% profit. I buy 3 contracts ATM with 4-5 $DTG. I use support/resistance as my entry points and it‚Äôs been working well. $TSLA is in a downtrend based on the daily and we have a better chance of seeing 285 then we do 350. I only trade Tesla. It is the only stock I trade.
Don‚Äôt bet against $TSLA. Catch ya behind Wendy‚Äôs!
!RemindMe 40 days. +120 $TSLA 15 AUG 25 250P 100
I‚Äôve been burned too many times shorting $TSLA. Thanks but no thanks Lmaooooo
I'm going to keep buying $RKLB.
Why Tesla and not $MSTR or CRCL?. $MSTR is worth 2x the underlying $BTC they hold
"When $TSLA runs/dumps, it's a big move. Always take gains after a 20%+ move on $TSLA"
$TSLA puts are gonna print.  Nice job OP.
You had me till you said $BYDIF makes a better quality EV ü§£ buying calls tomorrow üöÄüöÄüöÄ
"Show the $PL, not just this little screenshot. How do I get off to this?"
Does $TSLA go up if Elon is deported
The only bad thing about your $TSLA thesis is that there‚Äôs too much logic in it
That guy could sell 0 cars end of quarterly and stock would still be optimistic. I try to avoid $TSLA
"$TSLA burns me, when you think its tanking it claws its way back up.  market manipulation"
GG I followed‚Ä¶i‚Äôm sure you are gonna close tomorrow though if $TSLA gaps down?
No one cares that you happened to be right about the timing with $TSLA this time. Plenty before you have created reasonable DD just for the stonk to do whatever the fuck it wants.¬†
Ha! Expecting $TSLA to make sense. That's going to end well. Gl anyway
"$TSLA always recovers, all it takes is Elon tweeting something bullish. I would close sooner rather than later."
You are going to be the reason $TSLA pumps again lmao. TURD DD üí©
You are exactly what $TSLA stock awaits to devour. You wait and see.
"I've been thinking about the potential of these two companies. $ALT has their weight loss meds fast tracked meaning they could get approved at any time for pempemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist, which is in Phase 3 trial for the treatment of obesity and metabolic associated steatohepatitis.. The stock got hit over its weight loss report. It was ridiculous because it was based on 2 low doses. $HIMS has been hit after Novo said it was forcing customers to cheaper compounds. Alt isnt a big pharma company so it will sell cheaper. Compound pharmacies will be forced to stop at some point. All doctors who have been making a fortune are looking for alternatives because people want the drug cheaper. I haven't seen people on the diet drug  rav since phen-phen. Not only that but you have to take these drugs forever. . POINT here is that Alt will have to compete with the big boys but if they get into bed with Hims they will have a leg up. I love Hims because I believe management is quite intelligent and I can honestly believe they are watching Alt. . I already had 450 shares of Alt and 100 of $HIMS but plan to increase now. "
$ALT and $HIMS
"Years ago Martin Shkreli did a series of videos on how to analyze a binary event (e.g a clinical trial) IMO a useful watch if you can find them. . My primary question about $ALT is if their drug is acting on the same pathways or following the same method of action as approved drugs? . Surprisingly people seem to try drugs that work on the same protein receptors even after previous attempts at targeting those receptors fail to yield results. If it is targeting the same receptors, and there is evidence to support it will actually interact with them it could be a good buy."
$ALT is a full on gamble
$ALT has a  40% gap up. It's a volatile stock that has been filling gaps on both directions
$ALT does not stand out anyhow waste of thought tho
"Why would $HIMS customers or anyone in general take [Pemvidutide]( Aren't there already better GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonists from better companies? . Also, aren't there drugs in the pipeline that are much more lucrative, like retatrutide or even some of NVO's drugs?"
Here I am with $HIMS puts. I just feel like they are overvalued and should be at $36. Lawsuit with Novo coming up in August and their quarterly projection looking just ok. Just waiting for someone to find out where they are sourcing compounding illegally.
Been holding $GLD and GDX since gold was $1700
I'm balls deep in silver options ATM. But I was considering $NEM calls for earnings as well just last week.  These will print
$GLD leaps expiring in Jan 2026. Probably will buy again for 2027
"100 Shares of $GLD, I have held since Spring, I sell covered calls on occasion. . $CDE (silver mining mostly but gold as well, I trade in and out of it as it swings a lot. Sold quite a bit at 8.9 or so, maybe wish I hadn't. Still hold some, was hoping it would dip and I would buy back in. . I will take a look at $NEM, Is there a foreign owned mining stock worth taking a look at? It would be nice to benefit two ways from a future spike in gold and drop in the dollar."
"I‚Äôm going to go back on $GLD Monday. . The Vietnam deal, while better than liberation day, is worse than the last 90 days. If that‚Äôs what success looks like I‚Äôm expecting Wed to be red or at least some risk off. If not from stocks then bonds with BBB signed."
"$WPM, GDX, and $PSLV for me"
$NEM & Gold calls
i suggest $GROY too
Yep have had $KGC for a while now. Up 92% so far
$NEM I have a spread that is wayyyy in the money. might buy more
Why $NEM over other gold mining stocks?
"Honestly, I think $GLD is going sideways for the next 4-6 months.. $GLD is very good at being choppy for months on end."
"$NEM and B (Barrick) have suffered trailing performance compared to sectoral peers such as $AEM and the large South African miners (Anglogold Ashanti and Gold Fields).. I think $NEM earnings won't be anything spectacular compared to other majors, although they may benefit from a pricing mean reversion tailwind within their sector over the coming months."
"i'm long $BTG, $FSM, and $TFPM. no one talks about $TFPM. (not a mining stock though. it's a streaming/royalty company)"
"How are they chosen though?. I remember it once said: $TSLA, SPY, HIT, TEL, AVIV . That was a good one lol"
We seeing $BBAI running next week too?
Oh hell nah $TSLA this guy gay ash
I have a female friend  who works in politics in DC. She works as an assistant to some scrub politician. She said  she heard talks about a $BTC standard. The rollout will be partial (10-12% of Current GDP). Has anyone heard similar?
Not a fan of $TSLA
you don't like $TSLA yet it is 89% of your portfolio? Congrats regard! buy more shares to average down.
I'm my experience these $TSLA dips aren't very sticky
"U.S. manufacturing expanded for the sixth consecutive month in June, with the S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing $PMI reaching a three-year high of 52.9. This was higher than the forecast of 52.0."
As far as I know he deleted his account. I have $INTC in my watchlist because of that guy. he could have just sold during the tariff dip and bought $NVDA and would have been even.
I raise with the guy that dropped a few millions into $UWMC a few years ago
He's making a comeback by dropping his other grandma's inheritance on $INTC before their Q3 earnings.
!p $INTC
"What about the guy who bought 30k worth of useless .5DTE $BULL calls? I‚Äôm bullish on BULL, but even I think that was regarded."
The dude that always talked about carrying boats and went from begging on a sub to making a million on $MSTR then lost it in like two days. I think his username was Elon loves you on something like that. That was pure pain
If he put them in $ASTS he‚Äôll do pretty well‚Ä¶
$BBAI is worth looking at.
You people of little faith.. He probably hasn't sold $INTC yet - ultimate ultra diamond hands.
"so if he full ported $INTC at $31 with 700k, he would have 22,580 shares, which is now worth 506k"
Thousands of stocks and he picked $INTC to invest in! Imagine if he‚Äôd put that in HOOD! I think that‚Äôs the platform that he used to invest Nana‚Äôs $$$$
"I bought INTL during the Great Recession and held it like 10 years. Made 20%. üò¢ . I had considered $AMD at the time but nah, they weren‚Äôt making money. Some of you will know what an error this was. . I did atleast buy some $AAPL and Starbucks at the same time."

It‚Äôs basically a money glitch buying $NVDA calls huh?
$NVDA is basically $CSCO from the .com bubble. Watch out
$NVDA really carried the entire market this quarter. You timed it perfectly. Curious ‚Äî were you playing shares or ITM calls?
Damn I bought $NVDA as a meme and now I‚Äôm scared to sell. This post isn‚Äôt helping .
"Anyone to talk to about options? I have $NVDA, I have approximately a 51% return, but if I had actually bought options, and not the stock itself, how much would I have had?"
"Besides hope, you can also consider checking out an AI I found a couple of weeks ago called EyeQuant. It seems pretty good so far ‚Äî it tells you once a day after the close which S&P 500 stocks are beginning an uptrend. For example, it signaled that $NVDA started an uptrend on May 13th, and since then $NVDA is up about 18%. According to the AI, that trend is still in place. If you register, it also notifies you when the uptrend ends. What I also like is that it shows the backtesting of each signal over the past 7 years, so you can see how reliable it has been historically and decide for yourself. They don‚Äôt receive any money, they just provide the information.. If you want to check it out, here‚Äôs the link [www.quantsoft.cl/eyequant](. Wish you luck!"
Damn I bought $NVDA as a meme and now I‚Äôm scared to sell.
$GOOGL position 2122 stocks now
I‚Äôve been buying only VTI for the last 9 years and have almost $365K. I plan to put 1/4th in $GOOGL on Monday. I think the market is going to realize it‚Äôs undervalued very soon.
"shares of stock, or shares - not stocks. $GOOGL is a stock."
been thinking of selling my $AAPL for more $GOOGL what do u think?
$GOOGL will double in two years good move
"For WSB standards, this is a useless ass stock. For long term and non regard portfolios, good on you! It's going through the phase $AMD had a couple months back."
So you now own 2122 shares of $GOOGL. Why not show us the picture of the 2122 shares after versus showing us the 1000 shares before?

From a consumer point of view Elon starting a new party is bad for $TSLA because it takes his focus away from the company even though I doubt he does much. With that being said bad news is always good for $TSLA so +5% Monday prob.

"Let me begin by saying I don‚Äôt like the stock or the person associated with it.  The company is trash and makes no money.  With that said, the technical setup for this week is extremely bullish.  The stock is oversold and had a clear reversal off the trend line from September of last year.  It closed near the high of day on Thursday with elevated volume.  Average recent volume is 8 million, and 8.61 million shares were traded on a half day Thursday.  It is currently sitting right below the 20 $EMA.  A break above on Monday on elevated volume will be my confirmation that its breaking out.  If it‚Äôs rejected, I‚Äôll stop out most likely.  Jane Street, the firm that was just banned from buying and selling stocks in India because of manipulation, bought 16.5 million shares(7% ownership) of the company very recently(5/29).   18% of the float is shorted.  We‚Äôve seen violent, fast upward moves in the past with this ticker, as it doesn‚Äôt trade on fundamentals whatsoever.  I‚Äôm betting that one is coming shortly.  I‚Äôm not saying buy shares or invest long term, just put it on your watchlist and keep an eye on it.  "
I made a little on the $CLBR rip and sold everything.  I may try and scalp some on this one‚Ä¶

$WTF
I jumped in some 622's shortly after open. Took a $100 L and went on to $NVDA 160c's. Made a quick buck and left. Short market days are brutal for 0dtes. I try not to sit in anything too long.
I made some on $TSLA put and call earlier in the week. Trump Chop in effect
$NVDA was the move today
I‚Äôve never seen such a flat market like today.  It‚Äôs scary.. Puts all around and $TSLA calls monday
If I manage to hook up my intestines to an API call I'll release my Gut Feeling Indicator for FREE. It'll give you signals to BUY at the $EXAS top and SELL at the $EXAS bottom. . You'll finally be able to maximize your losses with it.
"Fwiw, if you carve out the regulatory credits revenues and gains on digital assets, and ignore any sales declines, $TSLA would have annual EPS of about $1.30. So, With Ford's valuation, its now worth about $14.. 350c I guess..... [Full disclosure: I HAVE 250p] üò¨üòÇ"
The problem with Waymo is how ugly these cars are ü§¢ Jaguar? It's hideous and they look so outdated as well. $GOOGL needs to step up their game fr.
"I used to be one of the bears. I wanted to see the current administration flounder the economy causing stocks to go down. I wanted $TSLA to go down significant amounts and I wanted to profit off of their demise. I realized not too long ago that the stock market will go up no matter who is in charge. It's true that stocks only go up, and it usually takes a company going bankrupt for a stock to actually go down in significant ways."
$CLBR to PEW can‚Äôt come soon enough!!

Any news with $CLBR on the 4th?
$ASTS is lookin good man!
"Usually I‚Äôm at work but decided to go in later this day. Saw Tom Lee on CNBC announcing he‚Äôs been named Chairman of the board of this ETH treasury company Bitmine Immersion Technology $BMNR (they also own Bitcoin)‚Ä¶went on hood and saw the damn thing was already up 100%. Bought a few and it kept going up so I sold most TSLL and bought more. Used one of these ai chatbots to review what the sec filing was all about and thought it be better to keep til Friday when the private notes closed instead of selling when it was 75 the other day. Glad I did! Took some profit today and bought some $MSTR and $GLXY (not pumping anything but surprised more people aren‚Äôt talking about $GLXY, they have bitcoin, own data centers, and work with Coreweave, like am I missing something?). "
Saw Tom Lee on CNBC Monday morning and just said YOLO - $BMNR
This was my finding $PLTR early lol got lucky af
"TSLL out, $BMNR in. This is how legends are made."
"$DSM is the next hot thing and don't need much DD for $TMC , the bill that just passed yesterday will also put billions of funding into the $DSM branche"
"Dude, great catch on $BMNR. Tom Lee stepping in as Chairman is no joke, that kind of credibility boost (at least partially) explains the pop"
Idk what to do next. Hopefully $CRCL drop on Monday
$CRAI gonna whip this boy into shape
"Are you still holding these? $CRCL will be $150 in a week, 2 at most."
Betting against the hype. $CRCL is regarded and you're ultra-regarded for trying to time the downfall. With higher education funds. Dumbass

Im there with you OP. My strategy is $SOFI calls for the next earnings to try and break out of the 1500 to 2k field to the 10 to 15k field.  I got 21 X 21$ August 15 $SOFI calls. I just need it to hit 25 to 30 for my sell.
"Honest reaction, trading options on low volume stocks is tough. Low volume stock already means it‚Äôs not on folks radar to begin with then you shrink your ‚Äúbuyer‚Äù even further by trading options.. I risked a much smaller amount on $ANAB (biotech) and on a day the stock rallied 10% my option didn‚Äôt move more then actual shares because there just weren‚Äôt enough buyers to pump the options price.. Stick to high daily trade volume stock for options plays."

 Surprised $NVDA has got this high without access to China market
"TSLA:. ‚Ä¢ $7,500 ends after September 30.. ‚Ä¢ Regulatory credits end tomorrow.. BBB cancels both.  $TSLA will now likely be negative $FCF by year end.. The market is asleep on this."
"How I almost lost money to a crypto scam:. Well, ""almost"" is pushing it, because even as regarded as I am, I am not regarded enough to run random code on the Internet.. Scammer in this video provides code to execute a smart contract on Remix $IDE in the Solidity language.. He claims the code runs a bot that snipes new tokens--theoretically finds newly listed tokens, buys them before anyone else does, then sells them just as quickly to make a profit.. Sounds too good to be true and it is.. If you study the code, what it actually does is funnel the fund you put into the smart contract into his wallet. The code tries to hide the receiver wallet address behind several layers of convoluted code.. It is an interesting adventure. I've messed with Solidity and smart contracts in college, so I have a spidey sense for what is possible with smart contracts and this seemed too scammy.. I'll explain how my spidey sense was tingled if anyone is interested.. Stay safe, regards."

$UPS is offering buyouts to delivery drivers for the first time in its 117-year history. The company is seeking cost savings because of stagnant parcel volumes and soaring labor costs in the US . Didn't they agree to a passive raise?

Congrats man. I think $AMD has more upside than $NVDA at this point.
Why is $AAPL in the AI News Overview? üòÇ
"The next time interest rates go up, you will lose your shirt with bonds. Sell everything except half your position in $NVDA, and stop watching it every day. If NVdA ends up at $500 or $700 in 10 years, what difference does it make if it swings down every now and then. You can pay attention to quarterly results and earnings calls. Just stay away from the childish swings, unless that‚Äôs how you make your money."
The P&L from $IBKR just hits different. I don't know how to explain it.
$HOOD call will print
"Enough suckers put in money, it becomes legit by buying some private equities.. Note that, this is the long term strategy for $MSTR. Saylor is going to cash out about the half of the Bitcoins and buy gold."
"No they aren‚Äôt stock.  . But Robinhood did explain how they were different, and perhaps OpenAI should ask ChatGPT to explain to their own management what this actually is and how it works and then maybe their panties would be so bunched up.. Long story short:  It works essentially just like any other broker handles stocks.. When you buy shares of $AAPL at your broker, you don‚Äôt hold those physical shares in your pocket, your broker holds them for you.  You have a contract where the broker pinky swears that the stock belongs to you and not them, but really‚Ä¶ you aren‚Äôt placing your hands on that stock certificate any time soon, if ever.. With this new Robinhood stuff, it‚Äôs just like that, but with crypto added in.  Robinhood holds some OpenAI equity and is parsing out promissory notes via crypto coins that Robinhood associates with it. Not a huge difference, just some technology and asset changes. You still get to trade the asset the brokerage holds as if it‚Äôs yours, but you‚Äôre going it with crypto instead of code running on a Schwab server.. Is it a scam? I don‚Äôt know, nobody outside Robinhood knows. But on the surface, it‚Äôs no more a scam than a traditional broker is."
"$MSTR stock is not direct ownership of $BTC, either, but people still do it. üòÑ"

You still have $AAPL calls. I am selling my kidney to sell $AAPL calls at open . No chance it won‚Äôt be theta fucked by then
$IREN gains
$IREN has way more to go. Also like $CIFR and $DGXX - similar plays. Both are playing out well.
"Hopefully, $IREN so far away & sold your options."
$TOST Gains ($100k)
Mmmmm. We can now afford butter on our $TOST
"I feel like all $HOOD would have to do to legitimize the tokens would be back them with a private equity share obtained by being an accredited investor, there‚Äôs ways to get equity in private companies"
Time for PUTS on $HOOD
"Which is more similar to the outgoing juniper network: datadog or robinhood? And that‚Äôs why $DDOG. At this point, $HOOD needs to buy another S&P 500 financial/fintech company to get in."
The $DDOG leaves the $HOOD but the $HOOD can‚Äôt leave the $HOOD.
"Yeah $DDOG trades at 13√ó sales vs S&P average of 3√ó‚Äîbut Profitable, growing, and now in the 500 club. That‚Äôs the future"
"Soo, $HOOD next month then"
"There are so many competitors in this space. While Datadog is known as the flagship and has a price to match, copy-cat companies rip off their new features within months for a fraction of the price. I don‚Äôt think $DDOG has any kind of moat."
RIP to all those who bought $HOOD ODTE calls earlier this week.
Good. Fuck $HOOD
$DDOG - 46B mcap for a company that literally just provides service for logging/log files? Am I missing something here guys? fkn highschooler could write up such service?!
I think $HOOD went a bit out of hands and big investors want to bring down the price to at least 40/50 to make a safe purchase. Let's see what Trumpito AKA Taco comes up with to drag the market down and make another entry point.
"The 625 calls were at .91 and rocketed to 4.15 amazing price action , I take screen shots  from my phone and go back and watch from my phone, the sweet spot is to get them at .50 to $1 and go for the ride. I was playing a dangerous  game with $TSLA selling calls today- because SPY was so hard yesterday, my bad."
You can win it all back in two weeks with $CLBR.
$MSFT fires 9000 more people while simultaneously applying to bring in 14000+ H-1B'S¬†. LMAO¬†
"So if I'm understanding it correctly, $HOOD introduces tokens where you can trade some made up value of a company? Lmao. How many more schemes are we going to introduce into the market before we realize these provide zero value for everyone in society besides HOOD?"

The amount of people in here talking about $GOOGL as if it were a short term play boggles my mind.. The google dip is a buy and chill affair.  A leaps thing
Is $GOOGL just incapable of getting back to its ATH? I've been holding so long I'm accumulating shares via dividends. This was not the plan.¬†
$NVDA is insane lol
Well guess my $TSLA puts are absolutely cooked.
Starting to think my 0DTE $TSLA puts weren‚Äôt the brightest idea. Felt cute when Tesla dumped almost 1% but now I‚Äôm cooked
CALLS ON $AZZ
All in on $AZZ
What does $AZZ do?
Must resist the primal urge to full port $AZZ
Bought 1k worth of $DAL puts
$DAL bears crying so bad rn
"$HELE puts, no one buying a $300 backpack."
I just made this post not knowing that $SMPL was even a company or that their earnings were this week. Do with this information what you will. 
Lemme get that $AZZ
I got no $AZZ this quarter so puts
"I feel like these companies just had earnings! I checked my notes and 3 months ago I bought shares for $KRUS and Delta during this week and $KRUS went up 30% and Delta went up 20%. Stocks usually do not repeat big moves like this 2 quarters in a row so beware. If you study past earnings moves you can see trends quarter to quarter since a lot of the moved are dictated by hedge fund computers. I chose $KRUS and $DAL b/c they satisfied a 3 checklist criteria I put together, it was not a random gamble."
"Playing $AZZ.  One of the major players in galvanized steel and construction is going to be big rest of the year, I think they will have great guidance forward."
Getting penguin calls because I like penguins.  May use the same rationale for $AZZ
I hope everyone got their $DAL calls in as suggested üòé
"$LEVI earnings report. ""Thursday's guidance assumes Tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and are 10% for the rest of the world"". They are not factoring the 30% Tariffs announced on Bangladesh and other few countries days ago"
$DAL Puts till Wednesday and calls on Wednesday
I heard $AZZ is gonna let lose and dump on everyone üôÅ
"$CAG probably continues going down. Don't know how that CEO still has a job, he literally dumped all their most profitable divisions since he took over which is how despite losing 30% in share price in the last year they are at annual lows have a PE ratio over 30."
$AZZ earnings Wednesday
"damn my $DAL calls would 5x, what earnings should I bet on next to 5x that again? Levi's or WD-40?"
I'd say $AZZ would be calls but it's already at an all time high...
I feel like $WDFC is gonna rip this week. So puts it is
"I'm a fucking moron but, is $ETWO actually a buy? I mean, they have some pretty huge contracts, ~600m revenue ~1bil market cap.. Edit: yep I'm a moron they're being acquired at $3.30, that's why... Makes sense. I'm all ""why are September $4 calls basically free??"""
$DAL calls the right move?
"$SMPL seems to be range-bound for god knows how long. It shots up like almost every earnings, now SP is sitting at the bottom. It can be worth of a shot.. "
"The morning dips are pretty good opportunities to play earnings...just buying $DAL 7/11's, or $SMPL 7/18's would have 3x'd if you bought on the dip after open. Earnings were decent for both"
Delta actually did good on their last earnings and the only ones to have balls to have the call while market is open. Calls and sell $CSPI it is.
Calls on $AZZ
"up 400% on $BRRN puts. free money. any time there‚Äôs earnings for some company you never heard of, puts is the way."
Fuck it $DAL picking up some calls here
Look at the options movement for $DAL in the last week for August and July monthlies.. Edit: July and September
Full port $AZZ
Chatgpt told me to buy calls on $AZZ
$DAL calls and $LEVI puts will be my parlay
"Calls on $DAL, $BRRN, SMPL(maybe best one), $HELE, $WDFC, $PSMT."

$SMPL with an 8.49% move since the morning low lol. I think I‚Äôm going to hold until share price is at least 38+ though.

"Looking at $HELE, call is tempting."
It‚Äôs all about that $AZZ today
calls on $DAL calls on $CAG
calls on $LEVI calls on $VIST EZ
"\> said everyone that calls are a correct move for $LEVI  . \> decided to reverse myself, ""it can't be THAT easy""  . \> bought puts. It was THAT easy, duh"
Hold this till open $DAL come onnnn
Puts $AZZ and $DAL
How are we feeling about $LEVI puts
$LEVI PUTS. Put the dog down
$DAL puts?
$BRRN calls i think.
What‚Äôs the move up for $AZZ tomorrow !!!!!!! Let‚Äôs gooooo
What the hell happened to $SMPL and $AZZ
How're we feeling about $ETWO 4$ calls.?
Bought some $AMD calls for a week out on a whim last Friday. Its been a good day after a tense week down.
thoughts on $LEVI
Also on $LEVI puts
$LEVI bears getting ass blasted.. Anyone who inversed is getting 300% tomorrow.
Can $AMCX stock spike can be repeated?
"Found the best puts to buy. $PPLT being an industrial metal would be affected by Trump's tariff uncertainties (bearish). Not only that, it recently went up a lot, way too much, which gives us another reason to short it."

I will never not laugh at how many people buy puts on $TSLA after it tanks then get shocked when it goes back up lmaooo
Need $TSLA to take that 5% back tomorrow thanks
"Just saw the OpenAI tweet regarding those $HOOD tokens‚Ä¶ come on back down $HOOD üòÇ. > These ""OpenAl tokens"" are not OpenAl equity.

OpenAI calling out $HOOD on their token fraud lmfao
Praying to the $RKLB gods
Why are you like this $TSLA
in a world full of hate and sadness at least i can still look at $TSLA stock price and get a good laugh
Twice in a row I watched hood calls go up 1000% then $MSTR calls go up 1000%. Nice.
Telling my boss that $RTO is fake and gay tomorrow.
$TSLA board of directors have melon locked in a steel cage surrounded by a moat filled with sharks that have laser beams on their head to prevent him from reaching his phone to tweet

My first thought that comes to my mind when I see these posts is yall keep thinking $BULL is gonna perform like $HOOD
"BULL, the new $LUNR to the moon stock?"
$HOOD WILL FEED FAMILIES
You know what‚Äôs crazy. Go back to any wallstreetbets post (or any other investing subreddit) from 2023 discussing $HOOD when it was trading for under $10 a share.. Anybody posting a bullish position on $HOOD got crucified by this subreddit. Downvoted to oblivion. Now suddenly it went from being the ugliest dog in town to the prettiest girl at the dance.. Everyone wants to buy low and sell high until it‚Äôs actually time to buy low.
All this $HOOD money is gonna roll into BULL
"Clickbait title. Not offering 18A to external customers is allegedly an option they might consider, but it has not been decided, yet.. Although it is still a rather disturbing news (for $INTC hodlers and bulls, which I am not)."
"$INTC goes up, next day Intel quickly announces some dogshit news and $INTC goes back to where it was. Like clockwork."
I don't think anyone expected 18A to pull in Nvidia or $AAPL unless China finally decides to make a move on Taiwan. This is nothing.
Eternal puts on $INTC.
"$INTC back to 20. Tide goes in, tide goes out."
only thing that will save $INTC at this point is pooh bear moves on taiwan and kim jong fat moves on korea at the same time
Posting this article made me realize this was the catalyst for $UNH drop
"For fuck sake, nobody was on this one in the entire sub. Nobody had this as a play based on what we saw with $UNH. I am a full blown retard and I am here so one of the 4 smart people can point this shit out for me. Puts on two healthcare provides in the last 90 days could have given anyone life changing money. Instead I have to read about how $GXXM the gecko is going to cause Tesla to drop 20% tomorrow."

So far so good. I'm just stockpiling shares since it's extremely undervalued when comparing it to Robinhood. Crypto will roll out to more countries in coming weeks/months. It's a way better trading platform than $HOOD and they keep making it more robust

"Hello friends, I'm back. Here is $UPWK, $UPWK and my explanation on why I bought $150K+ in shares.. At first, you see what looks like¬†a CAT. It starts off with the two ears. Looks like a cat right?. Wrong. This is the NINE TAILED $FOX Pattern, not just any cat. So as usual with the destruction of the hidden leaf village, $UPWK had some rebuilding to do. A massive dump candle hits like Pain himself.. But what they don‚Äôt see‚Ä¶ is that the chart needed this. Naruto HAS ARRIVED. You can see his hairline being formed in the chart. Which means, Naruto/UPWK is about to have some serious plot armor in the upcoming weeks and months.. You know what comes next. Naruto meets Tsunade. They didn't show this in the show but there's a bouncy entrance and the Chakara Massage Experience. Everyone knows there's a happy ending to Naruto because of his plot armor.. For that reason I believe Upwork will breakout $17+ and bought a decent amount. This is fully shown in the TA of the chart for anyone with a $PHD such as myself."
His $OSCR dd was accurate. I would follow OP to the depths of hell.
Bought $150K $UPWK based on Naruto chart pattern? I guess every broker needs a sensei in their life
"While I like the graph you've drawn, I'd like to make a comment that $UPWK has no investment value whatsoever"
Maxed out my ROTH IRA with $UPWK calls
You should look at $AMD. It always follows chart patterns pretty well for some reason.
"Large funds are making a ton of money shorting $MSTR. Well, it's time for some news. $BTC is about to break ATH, and $MSTR will have major upside pressure. Once $MSTR breaks the key resistance for fund shorts, it's going to go absolutely parabolic. $MSTR to AT LEAST 600 by August 25th. So many catalysts.  . - Tariffs? What tariffs?  . - Analyst EPS is -12c... But theyre going to have at least 870, if not 900 eps. Wildly an oops on their end.  . - First time $BTC holdings can be shown on an earnings, and this the first time $MSTR will do it. Will show an insane earnings.  . - Significant institutional shorting for options selling. Once $BTC hits ATH, $MSTR will rocket. IV will rocket. Shorts will cover.  . - RATE CUT LIKELY IN JULY.  . I am speculating if $MSTR does jump to 600, i make around 300k-500k, depending on the IV at the time.  . Anyone want to join?"
20K $MSTR YOLO
I did my first options today on $MSTR and bought one contract for 1.00 and sold it for 3.90 so I‚Äôm pretty satisfied I‚Äôm just trying to learn options but I think I‚Äôm gonna go on hard on some of these that expire in a few days.
Addendum. This is $MSTR EPS at any given $BTC price.. 
Ill be open OP. I am got a fuckton of long dated puts on $MSTR. Honest question. Why dafuck does FASB Matter. Not a single cent of digital asset markup is a real gain. Saylor is saying over and over again that he will never sell. So why dafuck does this matter?

$TSLA missed deliveries and it pumps 7% lmao
$TSLA - biggest YOY drop in sales in its history. . Believe it or not - completely bullish and up 5% . Hahahaha.  What the actual fuck. Any other company in the world posts earnings like this and they lose half their market cap. Can you imagine $AMZN saying they dropped that hard.
This is so obviously a $TSLA bull trap. I would not be buying here lmao
$TSLA should just stop selling cars and hit 500
Goddam $TSLA investors are so fucking dumb. Miss numbers. Rallies 6%.  Insane.
glad I sold those puts yesterday on $TSLA. Company is a fucking joke
This was predictable.  Entire sub was bearish on $TSLA.  I think one smart regard stated that it would moon anyway.
If $GOOGL missed like $TSLA it would be  -99%
$TSLA being green because deliveries are *only* -13% YoY is fucking hilarious. Buying $TSLA should come with a complimentary helmet
I don't care what direction $TSLA goes. Don't put your cash in crazy.

$GOOGL is actually green. Ima get emotional.
"> Tesla has halted component purchases and paused production of its humanoid robot Optimus while engineers re-work hardware and software. With only about 1,000 units built and parts for 1,200 procured, Elon Musk‚Äôs 2024 goal of 5,000 robots is now unreachable; suppliers expect the redesign to take two months. Problems include overheating joint motors, weak dexterous hands, short drivetrain life and limited battery endurance. Leadership has shifted from departing project head Milan Kovac to AI VP Ashok Elluswamy amid wider executive turnover. Tesla hopes to unveil a markedly improved, Grok-enabled third-generation Optimus at the upcoming shareholder meeting to reassure investors.. So... cars aren't selling. Robotaxi can't drive in the rain or without a chaperone. AI sex robot is pepetually delayed.. $TSLA +10% today on the news, probably?"
Almost comical that $NVDA is red PM the day after i bought calls

"TL;DR: **Redwire** (**RDW**) is basically a bunch of different space focused companies focused on the new space economy. It has fundamentally upgraded its business model by **acquiring profitable defense UAV (fkin drones) specialist Edge Autonomy**. Combined with a recent strategic capital raise (approx. $260M gross), $RDW is now poised for accelerated revenue growth, improved margins (cash flow positive), and significantly deeper penetration into defense and international markets.. # Redwire ""2.0"": The Merged Entity & Strategic Direction. * **Redwire (RDW):** A diversified space infrastructure company providing critical technology (avionics, sensors, power, structures, in-space manufacturing ‚Äì like their cutting-edge antenna capabilities from their Golden, CO ""Golden Dome"" facility). Moonshot potential for biotech like printing organs in space or making drugs. Involved in lots of MARS and MOON **shit**. Making robotics, making thrusters, solar arrays, etc.. * **$6B+ pipeline, $500M+ q1 2025 bids**. **BEFORE** adding in Edge Autonomy. * **Edge Autonomy (Now Redwire's UAV Division):** A proven, profitable manufacturer of high-performance tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with strong existing defense and international customer bases. Key metrics at acquisition: **\~$115M in 2023 revenue**. * Both space and drone stocks tend to trade at 10x p/s. $RDW combined will be at about **5x**. And **EBIDTA positive**. Not too many space or drone stocks can say that. On valuation alone this is a great buy. But really the company is just now unlocking its true potential as it emerges as one of the largest players.. # Edge Acquisition & Recent $260M Offering. The acquisition of Edge Autonomy isn't just a revenue addition; it's a strategic pivot towards higher-margin defense and drone markets. The recent upsized offering (net proceeds intended for strategic growth, repayment of the Edge Autonomy seller note, and partial repurchase of preferred stock) strengthens the balance sheet and reduces certain forms of dilution.. * **DRONE POWERHOUSE:** Edge Autonomy propels $RDW into a leading position in the tactical UAV space, especially for US & allied nations. This offers a counter-narrative to pre-revenue drone companies.. * Think of this like merging with $AIRO except Edge Autonomy is VERY PROFITABLE. * Drones make sense for a space stock. Think about Aerovironment making the mars copter drone thingy. Or all the other lil space robot bros.. * **DEFENSE INTEGRATION:** Strong synergies between RDW‚Äôs space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tech and Edge‚Äôs aerial platforms. $RDW has reported **350 million**(as of early 2024 reports), a significant portion tied to defense. Edge's inclusion should amplify this. **GOLDEN DOMEEEE**. * **Combined ability to sell to defense departments. Deeper relationships, bigger wins. Dealing with 1 larger company is easier for GSA.**. * **INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION:** Leverages Edge‚Äôs existing international sales channels for both UAVs and Redwire‚Äôs broader space portfolio.. * **BALANCE SHEET OPTIMIZATION:** The recent \~$260M offering (closed \~June 18, 2025) is crucial. Use of proceeds includes:. * Repayment of the seller note for Edge Autonomy acquisition.. * Repurchase of a portion of convertible preferred stock (mitigating potential future common stock dilution from those instruments).. * General corporate purposes and strategic growth.. * This significantly de-risks the balance sheet and provides firepower for growth, making the current valuation post-offering an interesting entry point.. # Financial outlook with 1 example line of business. **Valkyrie Hall Effect Thrusters ‚Äì Future Growth Driver:**. * **Technology:** NASA-licensed, best-in-class H71M thruster tech, commercialized with Phase Four.. * **Market:** High-demand for efficient satellite propulsion.. * **Bull Case Revenue (from Q2 2026):** Est. \~$1M/unit, \~300 units/yr capacity (Phase Four), $RDW 50% share -> **Up to $150M additional annual revenue for $RDW.**. * This propels the 2024-2026 bull case total revenue CAGR to an impressive \~23.0%, driven by high-margin, differentiated technology.. **OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS:**. * Continued leadership in core areas: solar arrays, deployable structures, sensors, avionics, and in-space manufacturing.. * Redwire's facility in Golden, Colorado (the ""Golden Dome"" site for this context), is a center of excellence for advanced antenna and $RFAIR systems, critical for both commercial and defense space applications.. **Here's some of what $RDW does besides the acquisition:**. **Big or Strategically Important Contract Wins (Examples):**. **Future Contracts & Opportunities Important to Win:**. * **""Golden Dome"" Project (U.S. Missile Defense):** Actively pursuing contracts for advanced space-based missile defense systems. Potential multi-billion-dollar program.. * **Next-Generation Uncrewed Systems for DoD:** With Edge Autonomy, well-positioned for autonomous swarming, AI-drones, integrated airborne-space intel.. * **Commercial Space Station Modules:** Contracts for modules (e.g., Orbital Reef, which $RDW supports) for research, tourism, industrial use.. * **Lunar Gateway & Deep Space Habitats:** Continued involvement in NASA's lunar Gateway, developing tech for sustained human deep space presence.. * Honestly the **manufacturing** and **biotech in space** is awesome, and a great moonshot to mention with moon contracts, space station contracts, golden dome, and mars contracts.. * **International contracts** from other countries space programs and private ventures.. * **RANDOM SHIT ($6B pipeline)**. **Acquisition of Made In Space & In-Space Manufacturing Highlights:**. * **Made In Space (MIS) Acquisition:** Pioneer in on-orbit space manufacturing, developed first commercial $DDD printer on ISS.. * **ISS Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF):** $RDW operates a commercial AMF on ISS, over 200 objects printed in space.. * **ZBLAN Optical Fiber Production:** First commercial product manufactured in space (on ISS) and sold on Earth.. * **FabLab Development:** New in-space manufacturing system under NASA contract for future missions.. * **Broad Manufacturing Capabilities:** Fused deposition modeling, injection molding, casting, stereolithography, subtractive manufacturing.. * **Bioprinting:** Successfully bioprinted a human knee meniscus on the ISS ‚Äì game-changer potential.. * **Drug manufacturing in space:** It is awesome, they have contracts already using their PIL $BXNCP.. # Why $RDW Now?. Redwire's strategic acquisition of Edge Autonomy, coupled with a decisive capital raise to strengthen its balance sheet and fund growth, has set the stage for a potential re-rating.. * **De-Risked Growth:** The offering addressed immediate financing concerns for the Edge acquisition and reduces some preferred stock overhang. There's no warrants. No bullshit. No risk of dilution from here. Just operating a combined space and drone company. * **Clear Catalysts:** Integration of Edge, scaling of UAV defense sales, continued space infrastructure wins, and the ramp-up of the Valkyrie thruster program.. * **Attractive Entry Point?:** The market may still be digesting recent events. As the combined entity executes and delivers on its projected $FCF positivity and growth, current valuation levels could appear very attractive in hindsight.. * **Strong Sector Tailwinds:** Increasing defense budgets, growing demand for space-based assets and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and the expansion of the commercial space economy.. The pieces are in place for Redwire to emerge as a significantly larger, more profitable, and strategically vital player in the converging space, defense, and advanced aerial systems markets.. Anyways here some shit I got, and yes I did buy this mostly before the recent dilution (screenshot right after the offering). Disclaimer: This is financial advice"
I‚Äôve been in $RDW for years. I wish I lad loaded more a few months ago when it dipped back to $7
"The company is trading at 1.0x revenue and getting tanked because they have $1BN of debt‚Ä¶ but they just slashed their dividend, sold their remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies (which will bring debt down to $900MM), and they could easily sell their international assets to franchisees (~50 hot light theater shops that could sell for $250MM at $5MM / shop which is a conservative estimate) which could easily delever them down to $650MM, a manageable amount and will take them out of any bankruptcy potential‚Ä¶. there is a long list of strategics (Restaurant Brands, Mondelez, $SBUX, MD) that would pay $2-3BN for an asset of this brand quality. I see the fair value of the stock closer to $10-11 (>200% upside) "

"Just read Cloudflare‚Äôs latest update and I‚Äôm wondering if people are seriously underestimating how big this could get.. They just launched something called Pay-Per-Crawl, which lets any website charge AI companies every time their bots scrape content. They work with 30% of the top 1 million websites and rising.. By default, all new sites using Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers unless the site owner opts in and sets a price.. This basically means Cloudflare could sit between millions of websites and every AI model trying to train on public content.. If this catches on, they won‚Äôt just be a CDN and security company anymore. They‚Äôll be the gatekeeper for AI access to the web.. Could $NET become the toll booth for the AI economy and spin up a multi-billion dollar high-margin revenue stream? Or is this just hype?. "
Nana didn‚Äôt hear no bell. $INTC yolo.
I buy $INTC every time it dips to 20 or lower.  It's a great flip!
"Interesting, I bought some more yesterday to bring my average price down to $24.50.  I may make money yet.. I'm hoping $INTC has hit bottom, which doesn't guarantee going straight up, but better.. Guess the new guy has no problem cutting heads unlike Gelsinger."
$INTC win!
$INTC is going to the moon.  Why?  They hired from the best pool.. Here's one who turned pennies into billions:. 
"You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.. Everyone I work with is jumping ship right now. Yields are trash and we have no customers for 18A. Even the new CEO is now talking about writing it off as a loss.. I literally work for Intel, and $INTC is nowhere in my portfolio."
"Intel and $AAPL are my only positions. I have 47k shares of Intel, and 1,000 of $AAPL. I believe Intel is going to double this year at a minimum. Within 2-3 years it's a 5x. Here's why. The company trades below book value, and everyone hates the stock. But this isn't just a contrarian trade. Intel invested $100B in state-of-the-art manufacturing capacity the past 4 years. They've invested $200B in the last 10 years. Yet their market cap is $100B? Plus, that $200B in spending resulted in $50B in debt. In other words, they have paid off 75% of it. This capacity is coming online. AI is exploding, Demand is 10x supply. And here comes Intel, with loads of capacity nobody else has. Intel is not even relevant in the AI market today, but that is a HUGE opportunity. They can compete on price with so much excess capacity, and they have a massive untapped market to go after. Intel is focusing on AI at the edge, and that is the next super growth area. Intel is right back in it. They will get a big piece of that. They also have new products coming out that are going to be highly competitive with $AMD. Power efficiency is really good with these products, and that also is a defense against ARM's push into CPUs. Why go through all the effort to switch to $ARM from x86 when the benefits are just not there? Intel's products are coming back strong, combined with the foundry capacity, this stock is going to rock. They get one large foundry customer at it doubles. But even without it, they are coming back strong."
"If it makes you feel any better, I bought calls on $INTC on the (unexplained) dip a couple weeks ago and this morning went from up 80% to down 10%.  It was up like 120% last week.  Winnnnnning.. That being said, I'm buying back into the dip with 8/15 24 calls because I'm dumb like that."
$INTC best hope was to hire a Malaysian Chinese businessman. So cooked.
And this reminds me the two biggest employers in my zipcode are $INTC and $NKE.
"Ok, I really like $INTC and considering selling $NVDA and YOLO too. . However, why $1.2M now? Please, tell me this inside trading! üôèüôè"
"You may remember me from last week when I called for $CRCL under 200 on the day, and under 100 in 3 months.. I continue to buy puts at $175 for July 11, 2025. I've averaged in at $8.39 / put. BUT thats not what I'm here to discuss fellow regards. It seems like the gay bear gods have blessed us with another opportunity I didn't see coming this soon.. Say hello to Robinhood. Yes, the ""To Catch a Thief"" inspired presentation was mesmerizing. I was on the edge of my seat, Vlad in a pinstriped suit was a pretty sight, with his tiny sunglasses and a middle aged rich white man potbelly.. So I'm here with my own, ""To catch a..."" spinoff presentation, I call it, ""To Catch a Short"" because that shit was all gas and no ass, all flash and no cash. it was a marketing event and the market fell for it.. **Robinhood‚Äôs tokenized stocks launch is overhyped:**. 1. Robinhood‚Äôs tokenized stocks rollout is overhyped. It is launching to only 150,000 users in Europe, since US regulations still block it. If tokenized stocks eventually become legal in the US, every major platform will jump in, and firms like Backed Finance, which powers xStocks on Kraken, are already years ahead.. 2. The idea that 24/7 trading will meaningfully boost order flow is also questionable. Robinhood‚Äôs own 24-hour market has shown limited traction, and weekend liquidity will likely be even thinner, mostly driven by retail traders.. 3. Some argue tokenized stocks on-chain will enable self-custody and DeFi features like stock-backed lending, but that is already happening elsewhere, for example with bCOIN on Base, and interest so far has been minimal. True self-custody is not possible yet for tokenized stocks in general, since these tokens represent ownership of an SPV rather than direct ownership of the stocks themselves.. 4 Launching its own chain, likely an Ethereum L2, will not drive meaningful revenue any time soon. Liquidity, user adoption, and dApp development are all multi-year challenges. Blockchain growth is slow, difficult, and constrained by regulation and user acquisition hurdles.. 5. People love to lump Robinhood and Coinbase together as retail trading platforms, but their business models are completely different. Coinbase earns explicit trading fees, while Robinhood quietly marks up crypto prices, which is a race to the bottom, especially since Vlad has already promised to remove token markups for tokenized stocks. Coinbase pulls in twice the revenue of Robinhood, yet Robinhood trades at a forward P/E of 66 to 74, compared to Coinbase‚Äôs already high 60x. The price-to-sales is even worse: Robinhood at 26 versus Coinbase at 12, meaning you are paying twice as much for every dollar of Robinhood revenue compared to Coinbase.. **Send it to $80 in a month**"
To Catch a Short: $HOOD Edition
"I mean you were partially right on $CRCL and still in the red what makes you think you‚Äôll be right here. Hood was about to rally today but we saw a market wide pull back, nothing really specific to hood"
"Bro really wrote a whole Bear Bible just to justify his $HOOD puts. Respect. I didn‚Äôt read any of that but I‚Äôm all in shorting Robinhood with Robinhood, poetic as hell.¬†$80 in a month? More like $80 in Monopoly money. Let‚Äôs ride these puts to Valhalla or food stamps. üêªüìâüíéüñêÔ∏è"
"well you are leaving out two things:. - OpenAI and SpaceX stocks. - staking, which can draw a lot of COIN users to $HOOD, especially with the 2% incentive going on. also pretty impressive how fast they integrated bitstamp into their system. CEO has a vision and executes.. oh and BBB gonna create one account per baby.. I think their July numbers are gonna be pretty good. 120 by next earnings."
 $HOOD will be $100 soon
"Feel like the capital doing $CRCL is the same as COIN. They have been moving opposite afternoon yesterday. Also, CRCL‚Äôs volume shrink 1/3"
**CRCL puts? $HOOD puts? My guy really hates money huh?**
it dropped one day doesn't mean your thesis is right. this is as stupid as the other guy shorting $MSFT. if i were you i'd get out asap.
"I bought more $HOOD puts.. $CRCL short is starting to shape up well.. Here‚Äôs more proof Robinhood‚Äôs big ‚Äútokenization‚Äù push is just vaporware. In the words of openAI:. ‚ÄúThese ‚ÄúOpenAI tokens‚Äù are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it.¬† Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval‚Äîwe did not approve any transfer.. Please be careful.‚Äù. Like I said yesterday this is a marketing stunt. Robinhood is basically buying OpenAI shares via an SPV and then giving retailers a tiny exposure. It‚Äôs not a product, it‚Äôs a marketing gimmick.. Market will realize soon, we see $80 by mid July. ‚Äî-. Mods said I can‚Äôt do daily posts, so just going to comment here. Let me know if anyone has a better idea. . Love it or hate it, this is my conviction, at least I‚Äôve got the balls to put my money where my mouth is and share it with you all for better or worse. . If you disagree share your positions?"

Anyone who traded before 2024 knows the market never was this bad you used to be able to swing intraday profit just holding both calls and puts since but now if you dont sell in the first hour but after first 30 you will miss out the top for calls since IV will only decrease as they consolidate stocks¬†.

How do you know when to get out of a trade? I‚Äôve consistently been hitting 100% option trades but get greedy. Last week was wild with 500-900% with $NKE and $ORCL. Do you place a stop loss of 23% and profit 100%?

"$BAER Bridger Aerospace.. They are an aerial fire surveillance and suppression company. Basically they have planes with huge scooper buckets and recon equipment which is used to fight fire. One of their biggest contracts is with the BOI.. Big Beautiful contains an extra 100 million allocated to the BOI per year for fire suppression services. Now that doesn't sound like whole lot, but BAER's total revenue right now is 100 million. Being awarded even half of those contracts would be substantial.. The former CEO, who is also a senator, put his shares into a blind trust right as the bill was passing the house. Probably to avoid conflict of interest concerns. This is the new age of grift in America and I have no doubt in my mind a Senator who helped get this bill through will be rewarded (with the people's money).. I see the stock going to around $4.50 to $5.50 (125-175% gain).. Position: 1,000 shares"

I would not personally invest in this for moral reasons but the private prison stocks flourish under fascism.  CoreCivic & $GEO are two
Indirect answer is after Trump is done with this his focus will need to go somewhere and that is going to be on continuing to deport brown people and to rattle NATO‚Äôs cages. . So go deep in $PLTR for the data to drive deportations I guess if you want. I‚Äôm focusing on EUAD (Euro defense ETF) as NATO countries increase spending to meet % of GDP demands.
"$GEO will do well. They have around 5000 empty beds and are already a huge ICE contractor. If Homan gets the numbers he wants, he will need 50-75k more beds.

It‚Äôs also the perfect time to buy calls because everyone is selling/will be selling around the 3rd due to the 30 day IPO hold to open the floodgates for IPO buyers to sell."

TLDR;. $CVNA uses private companies linked to its board members to boost its books and can afford to do so due to said insiders selling massive amounts of shares making it worth their while. .

Sell to board member's company who will mark it as less risky?. Someone defaulting?

"$CVNA has rallied¬†**>1000% from 2022 lows**, despite high debt and opaque financial engineering. This is classic¬†**meme-stock energy**"
Me losing money on $GOOGL at a sub-20 PE while this shit happens all the time with absolute shit companies that probably won't even exist in 10 years. (:
They took the auto loan and turned it into the synthetic CDO. They‚Äôre no shares available to short through $IBKR. Someone is pumping it up on low vol.
Institutions. Movement on $CVNA is weird
"Liquidity and easy financing, people are addicted to cars. . The used market is red hot because ALL new cars are luxury items now,  and they cost a premium to purchase and a premium to insure. . Not unlike the subprime mortgage meltdown, Carvana will remain red hot until there's a liquidity crisis and defaults begin piling up, repos, etc. . Also, people simply buy everything online. Carvana is the eBay or $AMZN of cars."
I‚Äôm shorting $CVNA and it has been rather painful experience.
"Look no one cares about the borderline fraud looking financials, allegedly. Americans don‚Äôt like the car buying process and this alone is why $CVNA will keep climbing until the economy blows up."
[BREAKING] $AAPL Weighs Using Anthropic or OpenAI to Power Siri in Major Reversal
"You know for a company with more free cash than God himself, $AAPL does a remarkably poor job of deploying it in R&D."
12 mins before the Bloomberg article dropped a huge 600k/min volume enter $AAPL. Wish I was this cool to know before shiz hits public.
You know $AAPL dropped the ball when they are considering going with MSFT's OpenAI for their LLM solutions lol
All roads lead to $NVDA
This is such a dumb move for $AAPL. Goes to show you how hard it is to innovate when you‚Äôre a large company.
Siri has been horrible‚Ä¶ $AAPL needs Openai or Anthropic to save them
W for $GOOGL too if they deepen their partnership with OpenAI
This is what happens when you're too greedy and don't wanna spend your $100B cash on those precious $NVDA GPUs!!
Siri is the worst AI in existence and it belongs to $AAPL. Hopefully they can do meaningful updates.
$AAPL is such a mess
the thought of taking inference compute from developers to allow $AAPL users to generate their shitty memoji‚Äôs is not the timeline i want o live on¬†
"My moneys on Anthropic.  $AAPL will wanna stay in the ‚ÄúA‚Äùs, and Microsoft is wrapped up with OpenAI so they would potentially create some conflicts I bet. Deep in a filing cabinet of partner policies somewhere."
All in $MSTR calls. 100% of my account. Zero? Or a million?
"There will probably be more ‚Äúbudget neutral‚Äù announcements for the federal government purchasing bitcoin by then, so why not. At this point though I would probably just buy options on $IBIT. Since Saylor has no chill"
Godspeed dude you might make it cuz $BTC gonna pump
"Considering everyone who owns $BTC is bullish on $BTC right now, zero. Sorry bud I don‚Äôt make the rules."
Million. Savor the tears when $MSTR hits $1T marketcap
"Not that the long-term prospects of $MSTR matters for the timeline OP is operating on, but I thought this was an interesting exchange on Odd Lots this morning:. [. **Weisenthal:** ""Now, so who's actually buying micro strategy because you know, I thought once the spot ETFs, the spot bitcoin ETFs came out, like this business model will go away, and it hasn't."". **Chanos:** ""No, because there's a wonderful sales job that's being done about the fact that this is an economic engine in and of itself, and so therefore terms like ""Bitcoin yield"" are used, and they've called them financial gibberish because they are, and in fact this will get arbitraged away ultimately by companies that will do this to try to capture that spread.   . In the case of Micro Strategy is substantial. It's still fifty billion dollars something like that of the difference between the value of the enterprise value of the company and the value of their bitcoin holdings.   . But the thing that really kind of shot me into orbit on all this was when a Saylor and others then said, well, no, you can't really value us on an NAV basis and so called m NAB multiple of NAV. You actually have to also give us additional value for the amount of profit that we make every quarter from the appreciation in the asset. . And I just pointed out, I said, well, **that's like saying, you know, my whole net worth is in a house that's worth four hundred thousand dollars that is now worth five hundred thousand dollars a year or two later, And my net worth is not five hundred thousand dollars now, it's two and a half million, because it's the value of the house plus a multiple on the increase in the profitability the asset.**"""
I can't wait to revisit this. I 1/4 of my sons stocks in $STRK lol
At least Im not the only retard whose all in with $MSTR
I bought $MSTR calls last week that have since gone 2x. Bought about 15k worth. Still holding.
last time i full ported into $MSTR i lost it all in a matter of a class period. . godspeed regard
Bro shoulda gone for $CLBR
Should‚Äôve put them on $MARA
How‚Äôd you set $IBKR to show positions on the Dynamic Island?
Why $MSTR
SP 500 qualification will be met today as long as bitcoin closes over 95k at 8pm EST. Huge earnings coming up. $MSTR is the stock of the decade to get into. Bitcoin going to rally these next 5-7 years. They have preferreds out now. Multi trillion dollar market cap incoming. Ppl are sleeping on $MSTR.
"Why is everyone shitting on this? $MSTR has all the potential it needs to pump hard in July. It doesn't matter if it gets into S&P or not. Or if earnings will be good or not.. Just go all-in calls right now and the rumors, earnings runup and bitcoin making potential new ATHs will take care of the rest. Get out before the actual news arrives. It's a buy the rumor sell the news kinda thing.. Disclaimer: I'm all in on August 1 calls, please help my bags."
"You can tell everybody in this sub is broke and retarded because they don‚Äôt see the potential in this play. $MSTR is primed for a breakout into the 1000s, 6 month consolidation and a bull flag on bitcoin. . This guy will be rich and you‚Äôll still be broke trying to figure out how everyone gets more lucky than you. It‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt see the potential in this play, these will print OP. To everyone who thinks this play is dumb, stop trading and start buying the SP500. $MSTR is an infinite money glitch that‚Äôs currently extremely undervalued."
135 shares of $TSLA
"I've bought one cheap put yesterday afternoon, when I saw $TSLA stopped responding to the two green days (before the Musk tweets). What makes you think it will just start going up? Even in case he stops that social media crap, why would the price go higher, than it was before he (re)started it?"
Still all in on $FUBO
$HOOD RICH?
Do you think $HOOD has more room to moon?
Im in a $BULL train
"Busted through 100k today. $HOOD is such a monster ‚Äî revolutionizing the game. First gain post, screenshot means sell apparently. I think I‚Äôm good ü´° $RDDT is next "
Thank you $HOOD
Announced Robinhood Chain but the anti-crypto bros will still tell you it‚Äôs a scam while investing 5 figs into it. . TOO BAD YOURE A $CRCW BRO TOO NOW
Had $HOOD at 18 and sold at 25 for some nice gains‚Ä¶.
I have 800 shares of $HOOD too! $100 soon and $150+ by eoy (they will get in S&P 500 in September)
$HOOD haters been quiet lately and especially today!!! It absolutely obliterated shorts today lmao. They're firing on all cylinders and still have more coming and coming FAST! Cant deny their place in the market now.
"$HOOD got my portfolio to 20,000 today. Thanks vlad"
Y'all really making me nervous with my shares supporting $HOOD now
Thanks I‚Äôll make sure to buy $MSTR and $IONQ-WT puts
bro you're supposed to sell put on $MSTR not buy calls
Buy $BULL and taste what winning is
Heavy betting on $IONQ-WT is crazyy
Did you believe what some specialists say here on Reddit about $IONQ-WT tanking just because the ceo sold some stock worth a few millions xD. Sorry but that was such an obvious mistake. I bought calls the second I saw the third post about how ionq will tank because of that
$CORZ calls?
$HOOD tokenizing the world. $150 soon.
"When $HOOD moons, we all buying yachts, right?"
"Just a note there have always been secondary markets for private equity shares. In the last decade, there have been several startups and marketplace for these rather than just having them happen through brokers or offline, known peer to peer deals.  They were not tokenized, though, and in the US you have to be an accredited investor to access them, sign up for the platform, etc.. So this idea of trading shares in non-publicly traded companies isn‚Äôt new‚Äî The new idea is tokenizing them rather than having to go to that other marketplace or through brokers or private deals. . That makes them more accessible and once they get wrapped onto defi, of course anyone could probably get them, but it doesn‚Äôt change the laws around securities offerings in the US and the need for accredited, investors, etc. That‚Äôs likely why they‚Äôre not available here on RH. . $PSIG fk Robinhood, never forget the company was founded on a lie to its customers to do the opposite of its namesake and rip them off for the founders hedge fund Buddy.  So don‚Äôt use it. But there are other tokenizations services."
"this is just tokens - if you want to own actual spacex you can do that via $ARKB Venture fund, I believe you can buy it in the $SOFI app. But this isn't available for me as a Norwegian. So I guess this is the next best shot"
Elon just threatened the entire Republican party lol.. $TSLA so dead.
$TSLA could open sub $300 tomorrow
$GOOGL is going to pretend the tweet was about it and dump 2% by open.
"Why do Boomers on $FBLA market place think paying in cash is some huge negotiating point? ""Would you take 40% of your asking price? I can pay CASH"" What else are you going to pay me with, seashells? üòÇ"
I will not be satisfied until $CRCL is below its IPO price
Why didn‚Äôt someone tell me $HOOD was the move?!?! üò≠üò≠üò≠
Holy fuk Elon keeps tweeting.. $TSLA in shambles.
$TSLA bulls prepare your anus
Guys hear me out. If we all egg Elon on X and him respond to at least one of us and then make him say something stupid about mango we can technically have a -10% $TSLA day tomorrow
You guys think $GOOGL gonna get fucked this week with $AAPL talking with other AI companies?
$TSLA bulls milked
$TSLA bulls about to be eating rice and beans the entire summer
do I but $CLBR tm
"There‚Äôs only 300 $HOOD posts on the sub, surely that won‚Äôt go tits up"
Is $TSLA gonna be below 300 before market open lmao
"I dub thy diversified gamer fund:. TECH: $MSFT, $AAPL, $NVDA. FI: $BTC, COIN, $HOOD, BULL. SHIT: COST, $WMT, $AMZN. FOOD: $MCD, KO"
I just realized that my stocks are Elon hedges. $RKLB $ASTS $GOOGL. Deep inside I knew Elon was a regard
"Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one. Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a $FBIN. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!. Holy shit the man has spoken ‚Äî $TSLA to $200"
Keepin‚Äô this full port on $TSLA calls going to fucking zero
$HOOD joins $PLTR as a stock i couldve bought at 20 and 5x my port but chose not to because I am a dumbass
$TSLA bers ‚ù§Ô∏è Elon's tweets.
1st it's your $TSLA calls dead. Then your SPY calls. 4th of July is going to be fun
Reading comments from $TSLA bagholders will be fun for the coming time being. LMAO
"lmao, Taco slept through a scheduled call, and now blames $T-PC and it's CEO for not getting the call connected.. Puts on $T"
$TSLA $310 tomorrow then sub $300 on Wednesday
Fuckkk $HOOD +3.5% AH
"Close your eyes and buy anything, except $TSLA"
"$TSLA was never down cause of so many bearish stats etc. But it may be down because elmo tweeting on BBB , ü•≠ , politics . LMAO"
"$TSLA to $150. No more EV incentives is a dick kick, and their vehicles are trash compared to its competitors. Aside from its charge plug IP, the company doesn‚Äôt have anything further to offer lol"
Why $TSLA Bols so quiet tn
Good thing I bought $HOOD at 43 like it was going out of style
$HOOD & BULL please make me that fuck you i quit money this year üôèüèΩ
Guys chill out. Ketamine induce Elon is different from sober Elon. Just buy calls on $TSLA a month out.  He‚Äôll apologize by next week and it‚Äôll rocket back up again.

$HOOD is at least a 100B company after today's announcement. Any shares below 100 is a buy.. Mark my comment and come back in a week to FOMO regards
$TSLA is below it's 200d sma now üíÄüíÄ
Jfc can‚Äôt catch a break.  Coulda bought calls on anything so of course I chose $TSLA.
I'm really happy with my $TSLA puts

$HOOD puts for tomorrow = free money
"Imagine getting allocated $HOOD shares in the IPO, dropping them when shit hit the fan, and sitting on the sidelines when it 10x‚Äôs. WHY. PLS GOD WHY"
$NBIS before earnings is a steal
How can anyone look at that 1Y $HOOD chart and think ‚Äòtime to buy‚Äô
$TSLA may go sub 300 tonight
$TSLA is a casino
"didn‚Äôt know selling my $TSLA puts would cause all of this, sorry guys"
$GOOGL seriously wtf
Imagine being a large institutional holder of $TSLA and watching Elon tweet your clients pensions away. Lol...its actually funny if it wasn't so sad
$TSLA will probably be $220 again soon.

My gf: He must be thinking about other girls. . Me: If only I could somehow  get access to Musk Twitter account for few minutes and buy as many $TSLA calls as I can.... Does anyone else have these fantasies??
$TSLA doesnt drop or go up on any actual news just based on Elon's behaviour on twitter.....stock is such a meme it makes gamestore look like value investing.
Bought more $HOOD calls at 3:58 pm. My dopamine receptors are fried at this point
Double digit drop on $TSLA tmr. Don't miss it
"ü•≠simply blames $T-PC for conference call issue, $T-PC hits back saying it‚Äôs not their issue. It just goes to show ü•≠is a ü§°& quickly jumps to conclusion without understanding the context"
Fuck the price action on $TSLA tomorrow is going to be nuts at open. I want cheap puts üòî
i can GUARANTEE that one of these will moon by EOW: either $TSLA or TSLI
Everyone is right about $GOOGL for making most money except it‚Äôs always PUTS that print instead of CALLS.
I've been waiting for $HOOD $50 lol
$AAPL just felt right and moments later... Kept 5 just to see what happens this week 
"Not claiming to be a trading expert, but this $BBAI $5 call expiring July 25th has been on fire the past two weeks. Volume‚Äôs been heavy daily, and the momentum just keeps rolling‚Äîtoday it‚Äôs up 110%, with a +$10.5K gain and the stock at $6.93. Open interest is strong, IV is rocking at 145%, and delta‚Äôs sitting at 0.92.. This is my trade, my decision‚Äînot financial advice. I‚Äôm just putting it out there in case someone‚Äôs looking for ideas. I don‚Äôt recommend copying me, but I truly believe that long-term investing in strong plays like this can pay off big time.. Check the chart, read the news‚Äîsee the momentum for yourself."
"Budget bill passed. More money, allotted to military and homeland security. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $BBAI announces more contracts with the government. . From my research, this company‚Äôs revenue has been steady, they‚Äôve spent a lot on merger and acquisition last year and R&D, and they have a back log on their services.  . this company‚Äôs technology, could be especially useful for security/biometrics during the World Cup. . Also 27% short interest!. I can see this breaking over $10 a share and staying above if more government contracts are announced. . Disclosure: buyer of shares at $6.5 cost basis."
"GATHER, $HOOD FAITHFUL"
Do you tink $HOOD has more room to moon

"You thought betting against $NVDA was retarded? | $10K into CONI, inverse Coinbase üò∏"
might as well short $CRCL
COIN has bounced off of the previous ATH several times lately. That‚Äôs strong support now. It‚Äôs in a possible bullflag and compressing after a huge move. We‚Äôre risk on and crypto stocks do well in this environment. Short $GLD or TSLa for a week or two if you need to get your bear rocks off or something.
ooh so close. If you had just added AI at the end you'd be up 43% this week.. $BBAI
Let‚Äôs goooo $BB !!
You got lucky $AAPL gapped spy up on old news. Otherwise my spread would've expired worthless.
YOLO on $HOOD
"Why is he getting flack for buying calls on a 10% ATH day? You guys have amnesia or something? $AMD, $CRCL, $CRWV and $ASTS ring a bell recently?! Those stocks ran days on days on days. $HOOD can easily do the same"
"Yeah I‚Äôm think 100 by eow, but problem is a WSB regard just bought calls at all time high, laws of the universe says this must go down. I need someone to make a bigger yolo on $HOOD puts to cancel it out."
"Thanks $ASTS, will wait for the potential dip in the next couple weeks when you probably announce you‚Äôre delaying launching satellites **for the 3rd/4th time** to probably jump back inüí∞ü•¥ü§ë"
$HOOD is. They're looking for regard translators
"Yeah, welcome to the club. I‚Äôve been locked in these $HOOD puts since May, doubling down every other week thinking there might be a dip in the near horizon or some shit. I‚Äôm currently down 48% as of today"
"Broke my risk management and maximum allocation rules for the 1st time to YOLO on BULL.. Position shot is from 6/25  . This risk was predicated on the redemption deadline of $BULLZ (6/30).  . I took the position that, given the crazy IV's on BULL calls, $BULLZ warrants were largely being used as cheap short-cover and that the redemption deadline was likely causing dilution fears.. Ironically, Webull nearly doubled the maintenance requirement on their own stock after the close last Friday (6/27). So I was forced to sell 1,050 shares before the close today. Still holding 5,500 shares.. "
$HOOD 2.0 or is gonna be like AMC/GME
Problem is no one knows when $NVDA will go down. Pure luck if you are trying to time
Hold on to this through September. I think we'll see $NVDA return to the 120s.
"All last week/month nobody was interested in $GOOGL, now suddenly every retard is coming out of the woodwork and explaining why $GOOGL is going to 200 in the next 72 seconds."
"I see you $GOOGL, I like the way you move"
$GOOGL is still down 5% YTD. Do with this info what you will (buy calls you fuckin retard)
I need $NVDA to go to 160 today or I lose the house

"Ah, so you‚Äôre the fella who got us from 174-183 in a few minutes. Continue pumping my 07/11 $DTG 175 call pls"
$CRCL is definitely one of the most volatile stocks I've ever seen
Should've put this on $HOOD
Some m*kers knew about this when they poured billions into $GOOGL and $AMZN during the last 15min.
 DST would have been a stupid hill for Canada to die on. $AMZN and $GOOGL already increased prices to offset the DST anyways. Would have been Canadians paying for it.

"To get bullish with $IREN, all one has to do is take a view on monetization of energy & land portfolio. Time to power is one of the most important pieces of the story. If the hyperscalars have 3 years to get to GW scale they can build their own energy. Oracle searching for 5 1GW+ sites ready in early 2026 - who else has this? $IGR new update yesterday shows data center rents are very strong. Mining Business. ~650M, 550M, 450M, 300M . If bitcoin does well or network difficulty stays constrained this can be much higher. If AI takes as much energy as people estimate, mining will only be done in markets with extreme power oversupply. Cumulative cash flows = 2B ($9 per share undiscounted) though all of this will be reinvested . Horizon 1 & 2 . 125M EBITDA ($1.25M/MW) -. valued at $12M/MW (100 MW IT load, 150MW gross) = 1.2B value ($5.5/shr) . Cloud Service. 30M EBITDA * 8x = ~$1/shr value. $IREN has 47MW with redundancy, great latency in Canada ready for conversion. If someone is willing to sign 2-4 year leases they will get GPU financing. . Assume they do convert it, 1B of financing, lease for $3/HR (cheap, $CRWV rents for $8.5) over whole 3-year chip life, 90% utilization (much higher now) - 3-4% of rev energy cost = 190M EBT * 10 = 1.9B value ($8.5/shr). Debt. 820M convertible notes at 3.25% interest rate (27M yearly) = -3.6$/shr. Corporate Overhead . 150M * 10 = 1.5B = -$6.5/shr. - currently subtracted from bitcoin cash flows but will double count for conservatism and dilution risk. Sweetwater 1.4GW April 26. Sweetwater 600MW Mid 27 . Bitcoin Mining Childress 600MW. Remaining Bitcoin Canada 110MW. Pipeline 1GW (2GW+ but assume they only get one) . Estimated Present Value = $1M/MW = 3.7B = $16/SHR. Potential Value if Monetized in a Time-To-Power Advantage Based on Precedent Transactions = $6M-12M/MW = 22.25B to 44.5B = $98-$196/SHR. If some of these were used for cloud, value creation would be higher, so no use distinguishing . Horizon illustrates the value capture clearly, costs 350M yet will deliver 60M-75M EBITDA valued at 15-20x, or 900M-1.5B, thus captures 7.3M-20M/MW in value. Even at 750k/MW on 1.92M/MW data center revenue ($160/kw/mo 2024 avg. rent, Cushman & Wakefield) you get valued at 15M/MW on a 7M cost, creating 8M/MW of value. At extremely low multiple for data center of 15 x 750k/MW = 11.25M/MW, capturing 4.25M/MW or 16B across the portfolio = $70/SHR. What initially gave me conviction - comparing 3.5 cents / kwh vs 6 cents for natural gas, >10 cents for nuclear, saves 220-570k/MW/yr. Capitalizing that along with other costs at 15x gives 3.3M-8.5M/MW value from energy savings alone. Then potentially couple M/MW from time savings, latency advantage, land value, power infrastructure, grid connected secured energy . SOP Target = $21/SHR. Mining Cash Flows $9. Current Infra Value $16 . Horizon I & II $5.5. Cloud $1 . Corporate Overhead ($6) . Debt ($3.5) . Horizon II Funding ($1) . Bull Case SOP = $84-$210/SHR. Potential Cloud $8.5 . Potential AI DC $70-$98-$196 . Risks - AI slowdown, data center oversupply, bitcoin crashes >40%. $CORZ $SCND $COMP. This is cruder, but the point stands even if my assumptions are way off. $CORZ potentially acquired by $CRWV  . 1.3GW secured power, 500MW AI DC under construction with $CRWV lease worth 7.5B (15M/MW) minus lease financing of 5B = 2.5B value . $CORZ speculative acq. EV = 6B. $CORZ mining = 18EH (200M EBITDA * 3x) = 600M value. $CORZ EV ex AI DC = 3.5B. $CORZ EV ex $BTC & AI = 2.9B. Implied value per secured MW = $3.625M/MW . $IREN has 3GW secured, though only 150MW AI under construction, worth maybe 1.875B (12M/MW, 20% less than $CORZ) minus remaining funding req of 125M = 1.75B . $IREN EV = 3.75B . $IREN mining = 51 $EH (650M EBITDA * 3x) = 1.95B. $IREN EV ex AI DC = 2B . $IREN EV ex $BTC & AI = 200M . Implied value per secured MW = 72k/MW . Being conservative and assigning a 2x multiple to mining = 460M = 160k/MW. Data Centers in 2025:. Bloom Energy 2025 Datacenter Report: Mid-Year Pulse. Executive Context: Power Is Now the Bottleneck. AI‚Äôs exponential growth is colliding with a fundamental constraint: electricity. . .By 2028, U.S. data centers are expected to consume 12% of the nation‚Äôs electricity‚Äîup from just 4% in 2023.. .Some hyperscale campuses are projected to demand over 1 GW, equivalent to powering 800,000 homes.. .This new reality is shifting power availability from a ""consideration"" to a strategic constraint that can determine the success or failure of a data center buildout.. 1. Power Access Has Surpassed All Other Site Criteria. .84% of developers now rank power availability among their top three considerations, far surpassing fiber proximity, regulations, and labor access.. .A year ago, fiber was the top concern‚Äîthis shift underscores how pressing the power situation has become.. 2. Power Delays Are Widely Underestimated. .Data center developers are underestimating grid connection timelines by 1‚Äì2 years.. .For example, in high-demand markets like Northern Virginia and Phoenix, developers think they can get power by 2026‚Äì2027, while utilities are forecasting 2028 or later.. .This gap reveals a growing disconnect and puts urgency on alternative solutions like onsite generation.. 3. AI Adoption Is Driving a Massive Scale-Up in Power Needs. .The median AI data center size is projected to grow:. .From ~175 MW today. .To ~275 MW by 2030. .To ~375 MW by 2035. .Much of this growth is tied to high-power chips like $NVDA Blackwell (~1kW per GPU).. .Many facilities will also merge training and inference workloads, further compounding the energy demand.. .There's also a significant shift to DC (direct current) architectures, borrowed from EV battery systems, to better manage the power flow for water-cooled racks and high-density servers.. 4. Onsite Power Is the Next Frontier. .Use of onsite power generation is expected to triple by 2030:. .38% of facilities will incorporate onsite generation (vs. 13% a year ago).. .27% expect to be fully powered onsite by 2030 (up from just 1%).. Reasons include:. .Faster deployment (vs. waiting on grid expansion). .Control over reliability. .Load flexibility for AI workloads. .However, air permitting could become a key hurdle‚Äîespecially in ‚Äúnon-attainment zones‚Äù with strict emissions rules. This is why low-emission fuel cell tech (like Bloom‚Äôs) is gaining favor.. 5. Reliability, Cost, and Load Flexibility Rule. .Reliability is the #1 requirement‚Äînon-negotiable.. .Cost matters, but only when paired with acceleration in time-to-power.. .Load following is now essential: AI models generate highly variable power demands, and older tech like turbines may not respond fast enough without compromising performance or emissions.. .Despite the focus on speed and cost, 95% of respondents still have carbon reduction goals, even if they‚Äôre deprioritized in the short term.. - Strategic Takeaway: Onsite Power as a Competitive Lever. .Onsite generation is no longer a Plan B‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic enabler.. .The winners in this space will:. .Build faster by avoiding grid bottlenecks. .Maintain uptime with reliable onsite solutions. .Use scalable, flexible, and clean technologies (fuel cells, etc.). .Plan around permitting risks with low-emissions tech.

"We like the stock, however, we like $CLSK (pure-play $BTC miner) even more."
$IREN.. past tense. Similar sounding to Iran. Bearish.
"And their new convertible note holders need to get the stock price over $20 or they lose the rights to convert which makes the convertible notes a very poor investment, and their convertible note holders are very wealthy entities.

"Fuck, $RKLB, I just need you to go up another 700%"
"Here's one trade to keep an eye out for tomorrow. $AMZN had a very bullish day with very high relative volume on Friday.

My dopamine juiced brain wants 300 $TSLA puts
So what exactly happened to $PLTR on Friday? Why‚Äôd it drop $10 in the last 10 minutes??. Im still grieving and trying to understand what the fuck happened to this stock that managed to take my port from 150k to 13k
"$BULL warrants expiring tomorrow. So, buying more calls and stocks"

I can't believe I sold $RKLB at 33. Someone end me.

How can u be bear on $BULL
"I think jphy launching their $2 billion ETF last week and europe was where the money came from..the russell was leading all indexes last week.. Today, Cleveland cliffs is closing 6 mills..US steel has closed one down near st Louis. The two main iron ore mines in Minnesota are down. Trump's attempt to save the steel industry is failing so far. Steel did jump up to $950 and fell back down because of tariffs. But no one is buying. Cliffs shutting down pretty much all its operations says a lot.. The big beautiful bill is going to be nasty. It is cutting Medicare and Medicare to working age people. That will hit the medical field..plus, debt topped $37 trillion. Add $4 more if Trump gets his deal..dollar is crapping. Gold is in record territory.¬†. Trump has also slashed funding for food banks and made getting snap benefits nearly impossible. This will hurt grocery stores and cause food inflation to hit..plus, increased theft from people starving to death from no food banks or food stamps to eat on..the food bank I volunteer at is shutting down July 31.. Trump also seems to be targeting Democratic states to cut funding. I live in Illinois and all kinds of programs are shutting down. Npr, libraries, food banks, summer meals for kids, day care, etc.. regardless of your views, that's money no longer making it's way to main street.¬†. Trump keeps talking tax cuts. But the tax cuts are already in place. It's nothing new. He's bragging on $5.1 trillion in new FDI but whining about Powell keeping the interest rates high..I think Trump is trying to fast talk the world into doing what he wants like he did to build trump towers..with no real pieces in place, he needs the fed to lend before everything falls apart..plus, he keeps saying he made a deal with China when it's the same deal..tech for rare earths.. yet, Ford shut down their factory in Chicago over not having magnets from China..why would Trump need to get 3 of the same deals with China ? I still haven't seen anyone sign anything in a ceremony. What happened to the 60 countries blowing up lutnicks phone to make a deal in April ??. BRICS nations are up to 40 countries now. India, China being Trump's top 2 to get a trade deal with. But, Saudi Arabia joined the BRICS too. That means they jumped ship on only accepting us dollars for their oil..they are accepting local currencies now. I'm pretty sure that's why the money is heading to Europe. Everyone knows usa debt and lack of use as a global currency is gonna be a huge currency drop in value as soon as everyone figures it out..Bitcoin may shoot up to 1/4 million from just the US dollar realizing it's debt.. Then comes this quantum computing thing...do you know what happens to chip stocks if quantum computers replaces classic computers ? You'll see Nvidia pull an Enron in a flash if $GOOGL or qubt really has mastered quantum computers. NASA and Tesla is testing qubt as we speak. I think ai is overplayed right now. It will grow more later as things develop. But, everyone has an AI program now..grok, chatgpt, deepthink, palantir, Nvidia, etc. no one is a leader on AI anymore. It's common..but these quantum computers are going to be like going from a horse and buggy to a model t. Nvidia might get left behind and everyone buying their data centers might be sitting on worthless technology in a few years. That might be why the entire Nvidia board of directors is dumping stock right now..Huang even said it's moving faster than he originally said... I think things are a lot more uncertain than Trump and his team are saying..Trump has bullied the media into silence. So no one is testing what he says anymore. He surrounded himself with yes men journalist and no one is able to challenge him or karoline leavitt. He keeps promising the moon, but I don't see anything happening other than fighting Israel and Saudi Arabian war and a downturn in organic trade...oh, and 23,000 trucking companies have gone bankrupt this year. Freight prices are so low, owner operators are running at less than break even prices trying to stay in business...corn is down to $3 a bushel from Brazil. It's recession in every industry but chips and banks right now...unemployment is gonna hit after summer..restaurants are showing discretionary spending... And government economic reports are being falsified...Jerome Powell said he doesn't trust them anymore. Bottom line: tru.p is bullshitting and the real economy is shrinking..q1 GDP was minus .5%..."

They told me selling puts you can make money. Casually sold some $RCAT puts. Got rekt thanks to liberation day. . Apparently you can sell before expiration date. I didn‚Äôt even know that shit. Also there is some stop loss even for options? Jesus why does no one tell me these things.. Someone desperately also assigned me their 39 contact shares (weird) and had to sell that for 48% loss. . Schwab has been sending me emails to join a training seminar. I‚Äôm planning to attend so that I can make back this lost monies. 
"Shoulda done $GOOGL, or maybe learn what you r doing"
Just buy $NVDA and hold for a decade thank me later.
Swinging calls is a gamble either way I sold my $GOOGL calls before close
Boys . How we feelin about $GOOGL at market open? I have 172 calls exp 7/3
$GOOGL calls + $PLTR puts = chef‚Äôs kiss.
How did you know $PLTR would dip hard before close? Suspicious
I also bought $PLTR at 143 calls at 64 bucks 2 of them exp is 7/03
$PLTR rebounding tomorrow and your puts are cooked unless you sell at open
"Bought $GOOGL calls, $PLTR puts, now I just pray to the market gods"
$PLTR down 9% and this man printed 791%? Bears eating good this week.
Why you didn‚Äôt tell us $PLTR was going to shut the bed like that I was watching and when I finally saw it I was done for the day my eyes were wide . I‚Äôm for sure snitching on you after this nap
$BBAI..
"I think companies like Upstart, $SOFI, etc that are highly rate sensitive. . Will probably also see a lot of activity in the market funding frontier tech companies because debt gets cheaper and the risk free rate drops."
"Buy your favourite home builder, mortgage company and real estate broker. You will notice they are low with rates st their highest in the cycle. I will be buying $COMP calls in size.. You can also short your most hated health insurer as the income they make from fixed income investments will be lower as bond yields fall.. Buying IWM calls is not the one. If rates fall 0.5% (look at Fed Funds rate vs 1 yr treasuries, it‚Äôs priced in somewhat) small businesses are not going to immediately hire more staff or make more revenue but the housing market will indeed be unlocked and transactions will flow again if mortgage rates can come down 0.5%-1%."

Sell the $CRCL and buy $RBC
Needs more $NBIS
I‚Äôm sure $HOOD saved him or help a hell of a lot.  I sold before the crash and didn‚Äôt buy back dump move and I made 65k on hood and I didn‚Äôt have as many shares. Now I don‚Äôt know when he bought or his average
lol... It looks like my portfolio but instead with $RR. . Altough I have funds and other stuff to diversify in a separate broker... altough still my $RR shares are a big size of my investments... I should diversify more but it keeps going up and I feel like I would lose gains...maybe if I reach ever you 200% or so... ü§£
$UNH and $AAPL leaps now are literally free money

Usually I don't participate in these talk me out of it posts. $UNH is below DCF models. It has crashed so it won't be primed for another.
Out with $UNH in with HIT
"Sir, you've had enough to drink. Go home and sleep it off.. $UNH is not a sure recovery. Their stock was propped up with 80b a year of waste and fraud in medicare.. And who's slashing medicare spending? The GOP.. I'm sure you can find something less risky to lose all your money on."
"Damn, the only calls you got is $AAPL"
Call on $AAPL but Put on SPY! What is that?
Something tells me by the way you type you‚Äôre a rich mofo and all this shit is Pennies to you . Anyway I also hit a similar high on April 4-8 and lost a good chunk but thank god I took some gains and put it into bull positions such as $HOOD and didn‚Äôt crash -80%
$AAPL calls and SPY puts‚Ä¶ help me understand.
That's one risky $ASTS put there.
"I'm new and make 6k in 3 months and lost it doing options and am now starting over. . You're handling this really well. Im glad you're not suicidal and all that. I've seen that so many times. The market taught me what I read. I did one Tesla trade and was up 2k, and, yeah. Now, I refuse to trade them until I learn charts better and start with the smaller stocks like $BBAI. I hope you're able to make it all back again one day."
"As someone who did the same amount in about the same time... 1. Your life is not money, 2. Your family needs the truth, 3. learn the lesson and don't look for another high to fill the gap, 4. find peace with you before moving on to something new, 5. NO ONE MADE THE $CHH BUT YOU AND THAT $CHH IS DEAD SO BURY IT AND MOVE ON!"
"Some experienced advice , just buy the stocks of its $AAPL , never buy options cause $AAPL is a nightmare for any hedge fund and the model you might be using for other stocks would never work for $AAPL."
. $150K -> $1.25m  thank you $RKLB
"Biggest win has been just holding onto 2000 shares of $ASTS and 10000 shares of $RKLB I bought last August. I know some people here think you have to be actively trading to win, but some of my best years historically have been years of holding appreciating assets and not doing much else."

"Come at me. I‚Äôve been making bags off $BBAI. Hop on retards, we have a new $PLTR in the making. (I‚Äôm in both so don‚Äôt come at me with the ‚ÄúpLtR iS bEtTeR‚Äù)"
In Feb I was all-in on $NVDA calls and held even as it was tanking after earnings. Down to $40K I went all-in on SPY puts after liberation day and doubled my money. Since then been riding $META up üöÄ. 
"up 269k YTD, mostly from $LEU shares"
. Biggest winner: SPX. Biggest loser: $CLOV
Balls deep on $MU at $65
Up 38% on $NVDA. Not a bad rally.
"$OKLO, $NBIS were my biggest wins!"
"Started with not sure, made slowly 4k by May and lost everything to $UNH then made again 1k but lost that to $CRWV last week so i guess am break even and Upcourse all time invested is waste.."
+ 38.6% YTD. Big win (so far) $TSSI. Big loss; holding 100% cash too long and missing April rally.
. April fucked me good. Was selling ATM covered calls and worked my way back collecting premium. $NVDA fucked me. Rolled one out to 27‚Äô ü§£ü§£ü§£ Don‚Äôt come at me because I‚Äôm poor.
. I got my back blown out by $TSLA bullshit yesterday but I am still green overall (down -1100 in one day yesterday though)
My best gainer is $RKLB at $690 lol
"Bought 267 $VG at $8.88, current price is about double that, literally the best trade of my career thus far. It makes up for ~25% of my lifetime losses and funds my futures daytrading for a while lol"
Up 100k on $SMCI
"Wins: KDEF 53%, EUAD 30% $VSAT 56%. Loss: POWW‚Ä¶.wild swings, currently down 20%. . Ford‚Ä¶newer position +3% ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Oh yeah sold Intel when it was up 28%"
". Up 38% YTD. That dip on March 20-24 was because I decided to buy TSLQ at the worst possible moment.. I was shorting the market with SQQQ and TSLQ on the way down, made some good purchases in April. $LEU and $CRWV were main profit drivers for the last couple months."
$NVO shares down 6g bit holding
". Started with 1800 in March, bought a couple SPY 600 6/20 calls for a premium when the market was high. Then it took a shit and I averaged down and ended up cashing out at the peak (on accident of course). Now in $AAPL, $CLBR, and $RKLB calls which are doing okay."
". Made a good bit on $RTX and $LMT, as well as Uber. Currently all in for Kohls (KSS)"
"Realized a $7,000 loss on $HUBS shares yesterday. Can't remember why I bought in the first place tbh."
. üá∫üá∏Leonardo $DRS and the indexü´°
. That AleaBito Charizard $GOOGL Leaps copycat bet turned my life around this year!  Kicking myself for not cashing out when I was up 60K on $SMCI shares.
Fidelity tells me YTD is +26.42%. I‚Äôd guess most of that is attributable to $PLTR.
Check back with me once $COMM posts earnings end of July. Prolly a millionaire after that.¬†
$RKLB has killed it for me!
"Win and mistake with same stock. Sold $CRWV for 100% profit only to watch it go up further to what would have been 200% haha. Cashed out some profit from others but holding strong with solid returns on remaining shares of $NVDA, $AMD & $MRVL - other decent returns on others but these 3 are doing the best of my current  portfolio"
"Don't have a screenshot but my biggest loss of this year was shorting $CRCL $180C expiring 6/20...I received like $200 or something for opening it and capitulated at $6,200. $6K loss trying to grab a quick $200 lmao. and the worst part is that if it was expiring one week later, it expired worthless."
Up about 30k thanks $OKLO
. Up this and another 120k from $OKLO atm
. $NBIS call
Recently had $MRVL calls $66K -> $23K -> $98K. My heart ain't built for this! I'm out. (I held when it dropped to $23K).
Guys Jmia(the $AMZN of africa) just got good news and its under $5 now check it out its not too late!! That stock have hit $60 in the past lets go back to the noon!!üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üí∞üíµüíµüíµüíµ

You should've bought the $175 $GOOGL call that expired today.  Your $120K would've made you 40 million plus.  . 
Cash out in $BTC.
all in on $CRCL at 143.53 trust me
"First post on this sub and honestly most of Reddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily (7 days a week) intense due diligence and research starting around May 21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of the decade. Don't just read to the executive summary and try and poke holes. Read the whole thesis and at the very least, consider the ""investment committee"" rebuttals at the end. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposing research, please, let this be an open discussion!. Note: references to ""days of blackout"" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June 26, 2025.. Rating: **OVERWEIGHT** | Price Target: $120 (216% upside within 12 months) | Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH**. **INVESTMENT $THSGF SUMMARY**. We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby $AAPL Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in the current market, driven by simultaneous insider trading blackouts, regulatory catalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policy alignment.. Key Investment Highlights:. 	‚Ä¢	Regulatory Moat: NuScale remains the only $SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission design certification. 	‚Ä¢	Political Tailwinds: Trump‚Äôs May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclear partnerships. 	‚Ä¢	Corporate Necessity: Apple‚Äôs $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseload power. 	‚Ä¢	Timing Convergence: 44-day $AAPL insider blackout + 27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminent announcement. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**. The convergence of corporate necessity (Apple‚Äôs AI energy demands), regulatory positioning (NuScale‚Äôs certification advantage), and political framework (Trump‚Äôs nuclear renaissance agenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investment opportunity. Our 30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesis inception.. Base Case Scenario (70% probability): Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives 200-300% appreciation. Bull Case Scenario (25% probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives 400-500% appreciation. Bear Case Scenario (5% probability): No partnership with any major player materializes, limited downside given current valuation ($20-$25/share). **CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS**. Corporate Strategic Alignment. Apple‚Äôs AI Infrastructure Imperative: The company‚Äôs February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across nine states, requiring significant baseload power. Unlike hyperscaler peers (Meta, Microsoft, Google) who have secured nuclear partnerships, $AAPL represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructure player.. NuScale‚Äôs Competitive Positioning: As the only NRC-certified $SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities (12 modules in production via Doosan partnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates.. Political Economy Framework. Trump‚Äôs nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support for private-sector nuclear partnerships, particularly those supporting AI infrastructure. The administration‚Äôs goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive private investment, making high-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating market viability.. Insider Trading Pattern Analysis. The simultaneous 44-day $AAPL blackout (unprecedented duration) and 27-day NuScale blackout (beginning immediately post-Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval) represents statistically anomalous corporate behavior consistent with major strategic transaction negotiations.. **FINANCIAL MODELING & VALUATION**. Revenue Impact Analysis. 	‚Ä¢	Single $AAPL Partnership: $2-5B annual contract value over 20 years. 	‚Ä¢	Market Validation Effect: Additional hyperscaler partnerships following $AAPL announcement. 	‚Ä¢	Manufacturing Scale: Doosan partnership capable of 20+ modules annually (as of deal signing in 2023). Ownership Structure Validation (from 2024 10-K). 	‚Ä¢	Fluor Corporation (47%): Military-industrial complex alignment provides execution credibility. 	‚Ä¢	Japan NuScale Innovation (7%): International strategic validation. 	‚Ä¢	Management Quality: CEO John Hopkins‚Äô U.S. Chamber of Commerce positioning demonstrates policy navigation capabilities. **RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT**. Asymmetric Setup Characteristics. 	‚Ä¢	Multiple Success Pathways: Partnership, acquisition, or broader nuclear adoption all drive appreciation. 	‚Ä¢	Limited Downside: Current valuation reflects minimal nuclear renaissance expectations. 	‚Ä¢	Leveraged Exposure: $SMR sector concentration amplifies any positive catalysts. Catalyst Timeline. 	‚Ä¢	Immediate (1-45 days): Partnership announcement probability. 	‚Ä¢	Medium-term (2-12 months): Nuclear renaissance policy implementation. 	‚Ä¢	Long-term (2-5 years): Commercial deployment and revenue generation. **INVESTMENT COMMITTEE Q&A**. Q: Dependency on corporate execution - what if Apple/NuScale partnership doesn‚Äôt materialize?. Response: This concern misunderstands the anthropological drivers at play. Tim Cook‚Äôs psychology operates on legacy positioning - he will not allow $AAPL to fall behind in the infrastructure arms race that defines AI leadership. Hopkins, as a Chamber of Commerce-embedded operator, understands that first-mover partnerships with $AAPL create market validation that benefits NuScale regardless of subsequent deal flow.. The convergence isn‚Äôt dependent on corporate whim - it‚Äôs driven by structural necessity. $AAPL needs nuclear, NuScale has the only certified solution, and Trump‚Äôs framework removes regulatory barriers. Even if this specific partnership fails, the thesis benefits from multiple pathways: government acquisition, other hyperscaler partnerships, or broader nuclear adoption all drive similar outcomes.. Q: Political risk - what if Trump‚Äôs priorities shift away from nuclear?. Response: Trump‚Äôs ego architecture makes nuclear reversal psychologically impossible. He‚Äôs publicly committed to ‚ÄúAmerican energy dominance‚Äù and 400 GW nuclear capacity - reversing course would contradict his core political identity. More importantly, Hopkins understands the political machine through his Chamber positioning. The nuclear renaissance isn‚Äôt just Trump policy - it‚Äôs bipartisan infrastructure necessity driven by AI competition with China.. Nuclear power represents Trump‚Äôs ability to simultaneously claim ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù energy independence and technological superiority. These are core psychological drivers that don‚Äôt shift with news cycles. The framework is locked in place by Trump‚Äôs legacy needs.. Q: Regulatory timing risk - Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval doesn‚Äôt guarantee deployment certainty. Response: This assumes static regulatory environment, which misreads the political moment. Trump‚Äôs executive orders explicitly direct agencies to expedite nuclear deployment and establish categorical NEPA exclusions. Hopkins‚Äô background suggests he‚Äôs positioned for regulatory navigation - not regulatory compliance gambling.. The May 29 Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval timing (immediately before insider blackouts) suggests coordination between regulatory completion and commercial announcement. This isn‚Äôt speculative - it‚Äôs orchestrated regulatory theater designed to create deployment certainty. The political framework eliminates traditional regulatory uncertainty.. Q: Market efficiency - if this is obvious, why isn‚Äôt it already priced in?. Response: Market efficiency assumes perfect information distribution, which fails with multi-dimensional convergence analysis. The pattern requires simultaneously tracking: insider trading behavior, regulatory timelines, political anthropology, and corporate strategic necessities. Most analysts operate in single-factor frameworks.. Additionally, the 30-day research depth required to identify this convergence exceeds typical institutional attention spans. Market makers have micro-timing advantages but lack macro-convergence pattern recognition. The information is public, but the interpretive sophistication required creates genuine asymmetry.. The psychological timing also matters - announcing before July 4 maximizes political impact while minimizing opposition organization time. This level of strategic timing analysis exceeds normal market efficiency assumptions.. This convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.. RECOMMENDATION. OVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.. Price Target: $120 (12-month horizon). Catalyst Timeline: 1-45 days for initial validation. Analyst: (redacted) | Publication Date: June 26, 2025. ***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***. Ascending Triangle Formation. The target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.. Pattern Structure:. 	‚Ä¢	Horizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June. 	‚Ä¢	Rising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior. 	‚Ä¢	Volume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst. 	‚Ä¢	Apex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days. Institutional Significance:. The ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.. Catalyst Alignment Validation:. The technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:. 	‚Ä¢	Trump‚Äôs July 4th symbolic opportunity window. 	‚Ä¢	Apple‚Äôs 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion. 	‚Ä¢	Political necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins. This convergence represents what technical analysts call ‚Äúsmart money confirmation‚Äù - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.. Breakout Probability Assessment:. Ascending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:. 	‚Ä¢	4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure. 	‚Ä¢	Multiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation. 	‚Ä¢	Volume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution. Price Target Methodology:. Technical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:. 	‚Ä¢	Initial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs). 	‚Ä¢	Measured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point). 	‚Ä¢	Fundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications). The technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.. Information Asymmetry Evidence:. Perhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.. This technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã. A few of my sources: *feel free to inquire on others*. DISCLAIMER:. I am long NuScale and other nuclear sector tailwind beneficiaries, with leveraged weight on 2025 catalyst announcements/revaluations. This is not financial advice. All investments come with risk of lost capital."
"> We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby $AAPL Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. . who tf is ‚Äòwe‚Äô?.. Not intending to be mean here but you‚Äôre basing a lot on this $AAPL prediction. I hope it happens, and it‚Äôll pump if it does, but Nuscale is already pumped to the tits. Your AI generated ‚Äòthesis‚Äô basically says: if the $AAPL deal doesn‚Äôt happen, some other good thing will probably happen.. Like, what? . I have a position (shares) similar size to yours but I won‚Äôt buy any more over $20"
Priced in. If nothing materializes I expect $SMR to go down to 25 over the next few months
$OKLO. [. [. [. [
"Unitl this administration is still in charge, $SMR will always be below $OKLO. I did not see the CEO of $SMR in beside POTUS when he was signing executive orders on Nuclear energy. . $OKLO is the clear leader, you can argue all day about the permits and design. BUT don't miss the important part, the people behind it."
"Interesting.  Bought some $SMR a few weeks ago after I sold it 9 months ago.. Owned $OKLO, but they seem more of a VAR?"
"There was a recent Odd Lots podcast with Michael Cembalast (of JP Morgan) and at about the 47 minute mark the small modular reactor situation was addressed. His main points were:. 1. Despite many years of trying, nobody has actually built one in the USA and a couple built in China and Russia went way over budget (and both China and Russia should have cost advantages over the USA).. 2. The idea is seductive, but nuclear reactors are not something that can be commoditized like solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines (which all benefit from a learning curve that can dramatically reduce cost of production because millions or tens of millions of units are produced). Nuclear reactors remain capital intensive and capital intensive projects require scale for economics.. 3. Cembalast says the costs per MW at NuScale went from $3 million to $20 million and they still haven‚Äôt built one. . My personal aside is back in 1976-82 I was a nuclear reactor operator on a Navy Submarine. The Navy has a history of building small modular reactors for submarines and ships that stretches back to the 1950‚Äôs. SMRs are essential for submarines and the cost for the Navy is orders of magnitude higher than what the commercial vendors are promising. Physics has not changed. Everything I have ever read about from the small reactor supporters are old ideas which have been implemented experimentally in one way or another (not at scale, in experiments). I am very dubious about the commercial application of small reactors.. Also, as a personal aside, I don‚Äôt think $AAPL would touch this business with a 100ft pole. I‚Äôd bet anything that is a total chatGPT hallucination."
Thanks for fueling my $SMR hopium
ULTY just added $SMR on last weeks rebalance.
"$SMR was going to sell Utah a gigawatt of SMRs for $3B (2015.)  In 2023, when cost overruns and regulatory burdens similar to those Westinghouse experiences with its old school LNMRs drove the price to $9.3B for a 462MW install, and the forecasted operating electricity prices weren't competitive with fossil even after subsidies were factored in, Utah cancelled the project.. Tim Cook knows nothing about how to operate a nuke plant and certainly doesn't want the PR fallout from putting nuclear reactors in anyone's backyard.  And these SMRs are designed to be put in your backyard.  For that matter, Tim Cook doesn't seem to think AI matters yet.. So everything in this pitch is wrong and regarded.. Long $SMR"
"RYCEY is the way to go for $SMR.Already have expertise in nuclear power subs, and now backed by UK Govt and a Czech contract"
This is so dumb lmao.  Why would $AAPL announce a partnership with a company who hasn't even built a single plant yet.  I like nuclear stocks for sure but the $AAPL partnership is just schizo talk.
"Wait your analysis is that there weren‚Äôt any insider buys in these two companies for 30+ days so they must be collaborating? LMFAO!. For the past 5 years of insider buying I looked at with $AAPL, the buying tends to happen in feb, april, august, october. Probably something to do with fiscal year compensation. . Regardless, this is regarded."
All of these companies are riding the hype while the insiders sell. $OKLO cofounders sold $300M last week (transferring to a tax advantage trust) along with another board member selling 300k shares just last week too. Look at the non sense news they keep putting out. $OKLO talking about government contracts that were first reported years ago with no clear financials. CEO and CFO go around spouting nonsense. Up and running by Q4 2027-Q1 2028 is ridiculous. Even their own website is hype (look at the building). They think they can build a single reactor for $34M with initial fuel at $35M. Good luck with that let alone getting approval on the design. A fast neutron reactor with a sodium cooling system screams ‚ÄúBOOM‚Äù. . I believe there are only 2 of this type of reactor in the entire world and they‚Äôre both in the middle of nowhere in Russia. The safety specs alone needed will bleed this company dry. They‚Äôll be forced to dilute and dilute while putting out hype to fuck retail. $SMR has failed miserably as well but at least they have an approval. They found out just how expensive nuclear truly is and why it‚Äôs been such a challenge. . Then this guy slaps a crazy theory that $AAPL is going to pick a public company that has had massive amounts of complications in trying to get a reactor up. $AAPL doesn‚Äôt even have an Ai product themselves. $AAPL doesn‚Äôt believe Ai capex is worth it right now and to an extent I see where he‚Äôs coming from. Elon saying he‚Äôs spending $1B a month on XAi with negative cash generation seems insane. ChatGPT isn‚Äôt profitable and they‚Äôre the largest use case company. How are they going to make money? $AAPL is in sit back and wait mode. At least write your own shit.
"Where was bro around May 21, 2024 when $SMR was around $7?"
The constant hate from this sub on $HOOD was the reason why I amassed 620 shares at around $10 a share lmao
Gj man. $HOOD calls have been killing it this month. Close that shit and roll up
". I waited till 3 mins before close. $182.5 $GOOGL expiring 3rd July. I know I should‚Äôve hold it few more days, but today was a good day. Let‚Äôs see what happens over the weekend"
what is up with $GOOGL today!
"$GOOGL as expected, happened to me last Friday, Puts, I sold it syrocked lol"
"Same brother. $PEP got up to $2+ today. Sold another batch of 32 at $0.56 and eeked out a small gain overall, but I‚Äôd be rolling in it if I had balls.. "
"Similar with $CRCL, had 200p 6/27  up 9.30 on Wednesday sold them, then went to 1.90 on Thursday then today they were up 22.00. Gains are gains"
Yeah $GOOGL really fucked us today. Rallied like crazy in the final 5 minutes of the trading day.
$GOOGL is one stock I‚Äôll never trade options on. Only shares
The universe isn't against you. I always thought this too but I for some reason held my $GOOGL call. This doesn't happen to me usually.
I had the same thing happen with $TSLA puts. Frustrating but at least I took a profit.
Yet people kept telling $GOOGL was a bad investment last few months due to chatGPT.
"Don‚Äôt feel bad, I sold my $NKE calls before today‚Äôs rocket ship."
"EVERY TIME I INVEST. I INVEST IN $NVDA, DOWN FOR 6 MONTHS. NOW I INVEST IN ATD, IN ONLY 2 WEEKS, DOWN 8%. How many fuking months before ATD rebounds?"
And the dip is gone. Those $JPM AI bots cycling trades are killing it.
"If you talked shit, you better apologize. $NKE"
My $CLBR calls will save me from my Nike puts right.....Right?
"$630K in green and suddenly he‚Äôs the Messiah of $NKE. You were a degenerate gambler last week, now you‚Äôre Wall Street‚Äôs unwashed prophet..

OpenAI taps $GOOGL Cloud TPUs in bid to diversify AI chip supply
It‚Äôs incredible how people don‚Äôt see just how set up for AI domination $GOOGL is. . They‚Äôre literally the only company that can actually vertically integrate this shit.. Who else has data on 8B people and the literal Tower of Babel when it comes to video content to train their models
"I was thinking to myself that $GOOGL and $AMZN and $AAPL have had it rough the past month and are next to break ATHs. Maybe this is where it happens, my $GOOGL calls went from -10k to +3.4k in a week"
"Here we go, everyone trying to create Deepseek type FUD because OpenAi will use some $GOOGL TPUs for inference. You guys know $GOOGL buys a gigantic amount of GPUs from Nvidia right? . Nvidia is sold out on the order book through 2026. It's all committed. . $GOOGL will go up, Nvidia will keep going up. Nvidia is the kingmaker."
"Very bullish on $GOOGL but it has been doing nothing for months as the market went to ATH. It's been hard to rationalize buying more and holding while you see everything else hit ATH and it's still in the depths. Having said that this week looks like a turnaround, earnings are around the corner....it's undervalued relative to the market. I will remain bullish until there's a reason not to be."
"Great for $GOOGL, possibly catastrophic for $NVDA. My read of this is that OpenAI is moving towards alternatives to bleeding edge but very expensive Nvidia chips, especially considering the fact that they are using Alphabet‚Äôs older TPUs.. For $NVDA, this could absolutely blow up their ‚Äúselling shovels in a gold mine‚Äù narrative that has been keeping their valuation so high. Not saying it‚Äôs over for them but there will be a correction and they won‚Äôt have the same ludicrous growth they‚Äôve had these past couple of years."
I'm super long $GOOGL with a lot of shares. I fully believe $GOOGL will make my retirement comfy as shit
The mere rumor $GOOGL would consider selling its TPUs to outsiders would crash NVDA‚Ä¶
$GOOGL is going to be the first $10T company
"\> There is no moat, no pricing power, no differentiation. Competitors will squeeze Circle until there is nothing left, and customers will chase whoever gives them more yield.. One angle of attack that is extremely common in the financial world is transfer incentives, which competitors can use to kill $CRCL if they know what their margins are."
"We're in 2025. P/E, $PEG, profitability... who cares? It's all about the flow and storytelling!"
"Banks issue stable coins. Stable coins become legit currency. . Hahahhahahahaha this world is delulu. . The only reason $BTC and other coins have value and there is money, is because of gambling and hoarding bets. Nothing viable, nothing stable, flawed network. . If Banks really adapt this. You are looking at a Dystopian society where classes and wealth is wiped out in software bugs. . Man if this Genius Act passed. Oh man the world is coming into sad sad times."
Think even Jamie Dimon might crack and $JPM will issue a stablecoin? I think they might be one of the only holdouts.
"I understand how they earn their money, I just don't understand why I the consumer would want to use it if I have no worries about fiat. I travel a lot and I have a Wise card that uses the $V network. I can keep whatever currency I want on my card. If I'm from Argentina and worry about devaluation of the currency I can transfer money to the wise card and keep it in USD, EUR or whatever. The cost of the transfer and exchange rates are minimal compared to the banks and I have the ability to spend my money with any merchant that accepts $V. I agree with you that I don't see a business model that justifies what is currently trading at but what do I know, tesla is a perfect example of market cap having nothing to do with reality for many years but eventually reality will make a house call and it will come down to earth. Thanks for the explanation"
Finally $SOFI Pays
A truely well played $LPTX.
honestly. I'm mega bullish on $SOFI. it's almost moving in tandem with $HOOD
"So, I am long on $AAPL based on the below possible Elliott Wave scenario. Just wanted to open this for discussion and get different point of views. I am not asking for advise, just want to hear from you guys. . How possible do you think the below scenario is to happen? Screenshots of the 1-hour and daily charts.. 1-hour chart:. Daily chart:. "
$AAPL Technical Scenario Discussion
Bro I've been holding 800 shares of $AAPL on MARGIN since it crashed to 183 months ago. I highly highly highly suspect alot of retail bought low too and market makers want us to tap out of patience or keep paying interest on margin used for the shares. The whole narrative on lack of AI innovation doesn't justify the share price being 20% below highs while sp500 sits at record highs. Im not selling until 230 atleast
$AAPL is a sleeping giant. It will randomly make a move when you least expect it.
"There is no technical for Tim $AAPL right now. Won't go up until they pay off the king. I think it will happen, but not for a few months."
"Last week, I thought a few of the Mag7 stocks were getting too lofty, and it was a good time to pick up some $AAPL. The scenario where $AAPL plays catch-up has played out a couple of times in recent years. I came across your thread over the weekend, and my reasoning was less technical than yours, but so far, you've made a good call!"
Guys if you don‚Äôt like what OP is doing you don‚Äôt have to participate. I like this chart. There was massive inflows into ITM July 18P yesterday. Could be someone expects it to recover to $225-$230 pretty quick. Also saw another chart (can‚Äôt find it) showing the last time $AAPL lagged the Mag7 it had a hell of a run to catch back up.. 
"$AAPL can‚Äôt figure out AI = $AAPL tanks below $100. Look at their growth rate for the last 5 years. If next year, $AAPL Intelligence is still dog shit, you will see a migration to Android like never before."
$GOOGL trade talks going well.
$GOOGL is trading at the same value as it was on 6/11. How did this call gain so much value?
Why the green dildo with $GOOGL
I kid you not I sold my $GOOGL calls not even 30 seconds before the 2% pump
So there‚Äôs obvious good news on $GOOGL for it to fucking move like a shit coin like that at the end but we don‚Äôt know
$GOOGL and $AMZN both ripped what was the news
Holy fuck $GOOGL what was that
Jesus.  That $GOOGL 3% rocket saved my week
$GOOGL pumping to ATH in 2 weeks guaranteed
$GOOGL and $AMZN have announced a merger preapproved by Trump.  New company will be called Gazillion.
11 million share candle at close for $GOOGL. Come on!!! What is it!!???
"that $GOOGL pump towards the end got me real bricked up rn. also, what‚Äôs the news on PLTR?"
"A pension fund rebalanced and sold $PLTR and bought $AMZN and $GOOGL, in case ur wondering about those EOD moves."
Thank you $CRCL bagholders for helping me pay for my upgrade to business class on my transatlantic flight this week. Your sacrifice will be remembered. ü´°
What just happened?. $GOOGL and $AMZN are flying
"Today was a generational rug pull day. Last 10 mins was literally robbery.. $PLTR, $ASTS, $RKLB. Any others?"
People who consistently play $TSLA and $PLTR talk about them like they‚Äôre in an abusive relationship
"Jim Cramer: ""I don't see $NVDA tripling from here"". $NVDA is going to triple from here."
"Was there news for $PLTR, $GOOGL, and $AMZN or just options driven?"
Let this sink in $PLTR bulls their own employees don‚Äôt own any stock. üìâ
Wait a second . So People thought ChatGPT was going to kill $GOOGL. But Google's own chips are going to power Open AI?
$GOOGL 200 by next friday
Rate the fucked levels of the following:. SPY 620c 7/3. $AMD 145c 7/3. $NVDA 160c 7/3. $CRCL 145p 7/3
"Holy f'! The only thing sadder than topping the comment board here, is doing so on the weekend.. Brb...ordering noose. Calls on $VITL (be healthy my survivors)"
"so if that bill passes tomorrow, puts on $TSLA ??"

Fkn Motley Fool told me not to buy $HOOD at 10$. Would've had an 8x by now FML. Serves me right listening to them I guess..
"That regard who posted about the $UPS subreddit wasn't joking, it's a clusterfuck of Americans finding out about tariffs. How is this not common knowledge?. [Dude orders a $4000 chair, gets $4700 in fees charged he has to pay or doesn't get his chair.](. [I just got a charge for $130 from $UPS for an item I'm ordering from Germany.](. [Package valued at $1850, I'm importing video games from Japan, $269 fees. ]("
What the fuck was that close? $GOOGL mooned like 3%
No one knows why $GOOGL ripped ?
$GOOGL going to $200 this year
"wtf happened last 10 min?  $AMZN, $META, $GOOGL all pumped like crazy"
$CRCL bagholders show yourselves laughing Spanish man emoji
$PLTR Is as big as Oracle now
"Hi, my name is regard and I bought $NVDA puts. AMA."
"Realized about forty k today on weeklies (GOOG/L, $MSTR, $NVDA.) Absurd, honestly. (When such things happen, it‚Äôs usually on a single ticker, and wiping out losses from before, kind of thing.) Unrealized at about the same, long, short, long, short and so on, but slightly up so I added some more hedges. . I just wish I knew what happens next. Or even felt strongly about when and how (that works out.). Sigh."
All I have to do is make a company called quantum AI $BTC infinite money printer it will make pltr look like a joke ü§å
20k LOSS $MSTR 0DTE
SPX today Call was the right one don't got it why $MSTR ?
My $AMD finally paying off
I bought $LMT on the dip üöÄüí•
"When bombings start i fully loaded on $AMD, $SOFI, $GOOGL, $AMZN and some others. It was a discount!!!! This week has benn the best for me, won even more than after the tafiff dump and pump"
I sold my $MSFT leaps for peanuts. I could have been on a trip to Nevada if I hadn't
I bought $CRCL 230P when it was 280 and sold for a +5% profit on monday.
"Going full port credit spread that they will stay below it before August. Any thoughts on this?. Not my first gamble. Won with hims, $CELH, palantir, SoFi. Their last earnings report was false hope and won‚Äôt keep up with that pace plus all the fraud they have."
The back alley of Wendy's is littered with people who shorted $CVNA
It‚Äôs a good trade.  You might get $CVNA chucked but it‚Äôs a good trade.
"OP what are you thinking dude??? $CVNA will go back to 360$ for sure and many value the stock above that.. Of course the stock is a scam and one day will go back to 150 but not in 2025, believe me"
I was up $15K this year then I played the $CVNA short game. Now I‚Äôm down $10K
"I've lost lots of money buying puts on these: $CVNA, $PLTR, $TSLA, $QUBT"
I think you're good but I've lost about 5k on $CVNA this year so...
yikes. it might actually. keep a close eye on $ROOT on how those CVNA/ $ROOT warrants play out
Meanwhile $AAPL and $GOOGL are down 20%
"Why does the market always go up?. Because it‚Äôs not the same market. In 20 years the top 500 will look completely different . 20 years ago we had Sears, Blockbuster, Circuit City, Enron, Rite Aid, etc etc.   Now we have $NVDA, Pltr.. in 20 years it will be digital xyz and new drugs, and flying cars, and 3d printed food and houses etc."
$BULL üî•üî•üî•
"Brother it didn't stomp you out you paperhanded the hell out of this position. Obviously $CRCL was going to fall, you just had to be patient and numb yourself a bit."
Tbh it‚Äôs harder to bet against meme stocks than good stocks. The float is very tiny so day traders and MMs can manipulate it a lot. Value companies like $UNH will tank straight up on bad news and no one will try throwing money at ‚Äúoversold bounce‚Äù. This happens to a lot of newbies. Just give yourself longer expiration (2 mths out) and hold.
"The exact same thing to me on $CRCL. I lost $291 , would've made like $700 if I had stayed in it. üòÆ‚Äçüí®"
holy shit take some profits on $RKLB don't be retarded
"Sold my $AMD leaps on Tuesday and it kept going up.  I'm waiting for a pull back to jump back in, so I kinda hope this guy is right for a little bit."
Did you sell the $CLBR calls?
Why does this look like a $DDD ball
"but $NKE stock just pumped to $72, you sold a call so you bet that NKW will remain below $62. . so you are losing money on this call?"
"Clipped 30 $NVDA 150s into the IV ramp  $9.4K realized. Risk sold, theta paid Onto the next"
I should really flair this as a loss $GOOGL
Same thing happened with on $UNH calls back then. Missed out on 6k if i held 10 minutes longe
I love woke stocks! $NKE calls paid big
Yup made 10k on $NKE calls! Great Friday for us! Congrats.
"Dude, $NKE is anything but woke, they like literally use sweatshops to make their product... I know their adverts might be all inclusive, but hell, look at Coca Cola they hire people to beat folks with sticks for protesting Coca Cola robbing their water supply dry and selling it back to them in an addictive form. . Corporate advertising, does not, in fact, tell you anything truthful about the company, they just want you to buy there shit (or stock)."
This makes me sad bc I was swing trading $NVDA for a couple hundred bucks here and there in 2016-2017 when I was a noob
"In 2011-2012, as a college freshman, I almost put $2K into $NVDA because I thought their Project Shield would be popular, potentially a huge jump in portable gaming, akin to the steam deck or Switch. . Ended up buying weed and beer and going to music festivals. . I forget what that would be at this point, but last I checked it would be over 1m. . I try not to think about that."
". I'm shortly behind you. I didn't get to play with $NVDA, but the Bed, Bath, & Beyond play (a couple of years ago) really got me caught up."
"jesus, I remember looking at $NVDA in 2016 - I think pre-split it was like $16 a share. I invested an held $AMD instead. Decent return but nothing compare to $NVDA."
$SAFX ‚úÖÔ∏è
I got $NVDA stonks.
Damn if I only knew about $NVDA when I graduated HS and also had $40K I would‚Äôve been set when I retire I bet.
So this is what holding $PLTR for 8 years will look like too‚Ä¶.. 
20k $MSTR 0DTE
$CRCL put gains closed and cashed out! Sold all but 3 reverse LEAPS that are still running.
It‚Äôs happening $CRCL dip!!! Sub 180!!!
$MRNA gonna skyrocket next week
$PRGS July calls
$STZ should print ü•±
$UNF has done fairly well in recent earnings and also were about to be acquired by Cintas but the deal fell through. Calls might be the way to go
as always the real play was not on this list...$CNC puts.. holy fuck what a drop. and 55p were cheap as fuck because expectations were nothing.
"Cathie Wood and Ark Invest bought 41,992 shares of Tesla $TSLA today"
"Who else is all in COIN after today's correction? I have $27,971.20 worth of 18 July 370 calls! $HODL"
$STZ calls
"If those figures are on the internet, they must be true, right?. GPT fact-check:. * Confirmed: McKinsey likely advised $WBD during this period. $WBD did rebrand HBO Max ‚Üí Max ‚Üí HBO Max, and the company is splitting into two. * Not confirmed: The exact billing numbers ($55‚ÄØM, $37‚ÄØM, $63‚ÄØM) and the specific timeline of advice haven‚Äôt been confirmed by either company‚Äîthey remain rumor-level from social media."
I was at $JPM when they brought in McKinsey for a project we were working on and I couldn‚Äôt believe how little they knew
"Consulting exists because we have limited time. Every person is a consultant. We all do it because we ""know things' others don't. So they ask us how to change a flat tire. We tell them how. That is a consultant. Upgrade it significantly and you get firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Kraft deal. I think they tied up the entire money supply of the US for that one for a short period of time. $KREF-PA knew how to make that deal happen. Others didn't. So they got paid a ton of cash to do it and they pulled it off. That's why we have consultants. toodles."
"I bought $70 and $74 puts expiring in a month, and I‚Äôm worried. $NKE doesn‚Äôt seem to want to pull back. Up $16-17 over the past week is insane."
Rollover your losers into $RDDT and ride it to $200
"Update : $RKLB is now up 46% and doesn't seem to want to stop, however I know that if I buy in, it's going to dump. Wendy's is calling."
"$MSTR has 40% IV, I‚Äôve never seen it this low ever. Buying some 0DTES tomorrow is a regarded gamble, but it‚Äôs good risk/reward as the contracts will be cheap as fuk. Optionstrat is saying that $10 otm at open tomorrow will be .03. So I can buy 100 of them for $300 and then if $BTC breaks out and $MSTR has a 7% day, I turn $300 into 180 grand? It seems like purely regarded asymmetry."

The risk reward on $CLBR is enticing
"$PLTR calls are genuinely free money right here. . DD: It‚Äôs incredibly overvalued, doesn‚Äôt deserve this market cap, they don‚Äôt really make money, but regards rather buy $PLTR stock than put food on the table for their kids."
"$CLBR literally has to print for me, i just joined a teams call at work from the bathroom and thought i was muted but wasnt, the whole team heard me taking a shit and now i have to quit. Donnie Jr please save me from having to show my face at work."
"LOST 4,000 on $CRWV PUTS. FUCK THIS STOCK"

"Remember what happened to $RDDT, APP, $RGTI and literally every tech spec growth stock back in 2025 early on? I‚Äôll wait for market confirmation but I‚Äôll be looking at the NBISes and CRWVs for shorts. $RDDT was at $80 and now it‚Äôs north of $140. I‚Äôd bet on a $20-30 move once the market is like ‚Äúummm‚Ä¶fuck‚Äù again."
"This is the biggest question out there.. If tariffs are called off, Powell will cut because labor market is softening.  If tariffs are put back on, Powell won't cut, worried about inflation.  If it's pushed back, Powell won't cut, thinking the problem still isn't solved.. But Trump's ego vs his desire for lower interest rates, I'm not sure which one wins, but I'm kind of leaning on ego.  It's the one consistent thing in his whole life.  I don't think he's ever said sorry or appeared to back down personally.  I don't think he can put the blame on anyone else either without keeping tariffs hiked, which is his other constant play in life (blame someone else).. Maybe it's going to be ego + insider trading and let his friends know he's going to tank the market again.  I could believe that.. Honestly not sure on the play.  Puts are cheap now, so that could be a play.  Gold seems to have topped and is coming down.  Cash is always solid, but we could have an even faster meltup if there's no tariffs that you'll miss.. I don't think it's priced in, though.  If anything, what's priced in is the current state of the tariffs, like 10% on everyone, and all the other new tariffs, if that even.. My conviction play is $GOOGL.  Its PE is super low, and they've got all that sweet tech, especially Waymo, which is crushing it.  I doubt it'll go down more than the SPY.  Plus, limited exposure to tariffs on goods.  The more the dollar craters, the higher their income will be due to currency conversion from other places."
"Threw about 6k on $UVIX today. Not necessarily because of tariffs. Just have a funny feeling. Fully aware it may be my dumbest play yet, and that‚Äôs saying something."
"I‚Äôm loading up on $UVIX down here. And when that shit pops, using gains to buy the dip."
"Ima just buy calls on $UVXY, last time tariff talk occurred the price jumped. 22/c for July 11"
"This time around, I'm thinking maybe I'm going to mostly sit it out until it dips, then buy back in. I'll hold on to my $TSLA puts unless they print first due to some robotaxi accident/fail."

That‚Äôs awesome dude. $RKLB looking good this week. Actually most SPACs are. Even $PL which I got out of because too much of a slow burner for me. I‚Äôm feeling the desire to sell some of my 10k RKLBs
I love this company but it‚Äôs priced outta range for me now. . But I keep DCA for $ASTS
. 1 year performance from $RKLB
Crazy... i need that with $LUNR
"I made a decent amount of money during tariff season when the markets were going down, it was easy money with puts but I missed out on the recovery (kept shorting and lost those gains) and lost more than the money I gained. . I had to give a comeback and I chose $SMCI. I bought the dip on Monday, bought the fear cause I know they wont make it easy for us. Technicals were looking good and $NVDA was ready to make ATH with $AMD already pumping. Swung these calls the whole week. I sold 30% today and swinging the rest 70%  "
You can thank me paper handing my $SMCI calls that expired on 2027 on Monday smh
It hurts me down to my bones that I sold my $NVDA calls to soon. Lost out on 15k. . You can‚Äôt win them all tho.. Thinking about a 22k full port tomorrow on SPY OTM Calls.. Stay blessed.

"$NKE abysmal results, up 12% on an empty promise that ‚Äúit won‚Äôt get worse trust me bro‚Äù LMAO this market has gone full regard"
$RKLB pumping over 10% today was nuts‚Ä¶.. My buddy sold his stake and literally said‚Ä¶. ‚ÄúIts gonna rise just because i sold‚Äù. And the next day he messaged me and I rubbed it in his face. And he said ‚Äúwhy is it rising‚Äù. And i said. ‚ÄúBecause you sold‚Äù
"COULDVE MADE so much money investing in SHIT companies all this time, but I thought I was smart ü§ì and chose $GOOGL FUCK ME"
"So wait because $NKE says 'the worst is behind us, ignore the 12% drop in sales' its still above 60?"
"First $TSLA, now $NKE... I don't think people even care if companies make money anymore. This delusional bullshit trains gonna keep pumping until it falls completely off the tracks, until then, all calls"
"In regard-sight, missing the lows of April (EX: $NVDA at Forward P/E of 20-21, $GOOGL at Forward P/E of 15-16) has me questioning my skill."

"Let me be a little more clear, since it seems no one noticed this‚Ä¶. $BBAI is mid-squeeze, and it wasn‚Äôt exactly subtle. I posted about it ~20 minutes ago and got hit with a couple of dismissive replies, but the signs were all there: huge volume, tight consolidation, loaded call $OI, and obvious short pressure. This wasn‚Äôt luck ‚Äî it was visible if you were looking.. I grabbed July 11 $5 calls at $0.50 this morning. They nearly tripled by close, and I more than doubled my position. Didn‚Äôt trim yet ‚Äî holding for that $1.50+ pop that could hit first thing tomorrow if this momentum keeps up.. Not saying this goes full meme, but if we see another volume surge and a clean move through $6, the next leg could be nasty (in a good way). Shorts aren‚Äôt out yet, and the float isn‚Äôt exactly huge. I‚Äôm ready to lock gains if it loses steam, but I like the risk/reward where I‚Äôm sitting right now.. Again, not pretending to be a market wizard. I‚Äôm just saying: this squeeze was obvious if you were paying attention ‚Äî and there still might be more gas in the tank.. TLDR: Up 100%+ on $BBAI calls, squeeze looks real, watching premarket for continuation. If this rips tomorrow, don‚Äôt act surprised."

$AAPL Executives Have Held Internal Talks About Buying AI Startup Perplexity
"Why don't they just build this.  There is nothing special about this startups technology, there's a $VC who built his own version just for shits and giggles.  Honestly what are they buying, the famous ""Perplexity"" name?"
Will Siri get jealous like GLaDOS and imprison the $AAPL execs..?
"$AAPL is smart, they will let everyone else waste their money on this crap, see who wins in the end, buy them, smack an $AAPL on it, and make trillions off it."
Feels like $AAPL may be primed for a little pop after trading sideways for the last couple of months. This news could be a decent catalyst once it makes the rounds.
"Tempting P/B  0.25.. Not sure about timing though, you know what they say about being right too early.... I got the right moment with $KEP but I am still waiting for $VALE and $PFE."

"As of this post, $SANA is valued at $654M. I [previously posted some DD on $SANA ]( am now up over 50% on 37625 shares at the current price of $2.90. Here's why I believe $SANA can 15X or more from here to a price of at least \~$43 corresponding to a market cap of \~$10B minimum.. **Background**. $SANA has technology that they use to modify lab-grown cells so that the cells are not rejected (killed) when transplanted into a patient. The genetically modified cells are referred to as ""immune evasive"" cells. As a proof of concept, $SANA modified donor pancreatic islets (islets are cells that regulate blood sugar and produce insulin) so that the donor pancreatic islets would be immune evasive and could be implanted into a human recipient patient without being rejected. In type 1 diabetics, they are missing the cells that produce insulin, so replacement islets are a known cure for type 1 diabetes, but getting them to survive without immunosuppression has been an impossible task. One patient was implanted with immune evasive islets by $SANA on Dec. 2, 2024. The patient did not need to take immunosuppression after receiving the immune evasive donor pancreatic islets in order for the transplanted islets to survive (normally donor islets are rejected/killed within a couple weeks).. 6 month data from the Dec. 2 transplant was just released this past Monday (June 23, 2025) and revealed that the transplanted immune evasive pancreatic islet cells were still alive and functional (producing insulin), eliminating any doubt that $SANA'S tech will enable lab-grown cells to survive long-term in patients ([source]( This is the FIRST AND ONLY TIME that human IMMUNE EVASIVE CELLS have been transplanted and demonstrated to SURVIVE LONG TERM in a HUMAN. In other words, $SANA now owns unique technology that will be vital for not just enabling a type 1 diabetes cure (the survival of transplanted lab-grown pancreatic islets), but any therapy or cure that involves avoiding rejection while transplanting lab-grown cells or tissues into a patient.. It's worth noting that for type 1 diabetes in particular is an autoimmune disease, meaning the patient's own immune system kills off their insulin producing cells. For this reason, aside from rejection, immune evasion is essential to a type 1 diabetes cure just due to the nature of the disease. Genetically matched islets would still have their insulin producing cells killed off without immune evasive technology.. **What's next for $SANA? (transplanting immune evasive stem cell derived pancreatic islets)**. $SANA'S initial transplant study in 1 patient used pancreatic islets from a deceased donor. Obviously, this is not a scalable source of the pancreatic islets needed to cure type 1 diabetes. $SANA recognized this and has already produced pancreatic islets from stem cells that are immune evasive. They have a master stem cell line with the immune evasive edits (that is now very well characterized to avoid unwanted mutations) that they can use to grow as many pancreatic islets as they want in the lab from scratch. These are referred to as ""stem cell derived islets"". Scientists are very good at growing functional islets from stem cells in the lab now, so this is not a problem that $SANA has to worry about. The islets they can produce from their immune evasive stem cell line are functional enough to cure type 1 diabetes. A recent ongoing trial from another company, Vertex, demonstrated that stem cell derived islets can be used to cure type 1 diabetes ([source]( however, critically, Vertex has no solution for the rejection problem and the patients in their study had to take immunosuppressants to avoid rejecting the stem cell derived islets. 1 of the 14 initial patients in Vertex's study DIED due to being on the immunosuppressants (which severely weakens a patients immune system, making them vulnerable to simple infections). The patient died from a fungal infection known to affect people on immunosuppression and that people with healthy immune systems would have normally avoided ([source](. $SANA has now made immune evasive stem cell derived islets which are known to be functional enough to cure type 1 diabetes. Vertex's trial, which relied on deadly immunosuppression, confirms beyond any doubt that stem cell derived islets can cure type 1 diabetes. Considering $SANA'S recent 6 month data in the first human patient transplanted with immune evasive islets, it is now essentially known that $SANA'S immune evasive stem cell derived islets will last long term in patients without immunosuppression, since they use the same immune evasive tehcnology that worked in the first human patient. Thus, all that remains at this point is for $SANA to start human trials with their immune evasive stem cell derived islets. Sure, they have to go through the trials, but  the current evidence overwhelmingly indicates that $SANA'S immune evasive stem cell derived islets will be successful.. **Competition**. $SANA is light years ahead of any potential competition. They are the only company with demonstrably successful long-term immune evasive technology. There are 2 other companies, Vertex and $CRSP, that claim to be working on immune evasive pancreatic islets; however, none of these 2 companies have demonstrated long-term working immune evasive technology. Moreover, they won't simply be able to copy $SANA'S tech since it will violate their patents. In order to even compete with $SANA regarding immune evasive cells, Vertex and $CRSP have to come up with an alternative immune evasive technology that $SANA has not already patented and that demonstrably works in humans long-term. This is not a trivial feat. Both companies are severely behind $SANA. Both $CRSP and Vertex list their immune evasive islet therapies as ""research stage"" on their pipeline pages ([source Vertex]( [source CRISPR]( In other words, they have no real chance of catching up to $SANA any time soon, and they may never.. While Vertex has transplanted stem cell derived islets into humans that cure type 1 diabetes, as mentioned above, the patients needed to be on immunosuppressant drugs to avoid rejection of the transplanted islets. 1 out of 14 patients DIED due to immunosuppression complications. This is a LETHAL FLAW in the Vertex approach. The tradeoff of curing type 1 diabetes, but permanently weakening your immune system and greatly increasing chance of death due to simple infections is simply unacceptable for nearly all type 1 diabetes patients.. **How much is a type 1 diabetes cure worth?**. Let's look at some statistics to get a ballpark idea to guide us in valuing a type 1 diabetes cure.. Approximate number of type 1 diabetics in United States: 1.5 million     Worldwide: 9.1 million  ([source](. Average lifetime cost of type 1 diabetes per person in the United States is $500K ([source]( Given that, a reasonable cost for a type 1 diabetes cure might be some number less than $500K. For the sake of coming up with some estimate, let's assume that $SANA charges $100K for their type 1 diabetes cure (it could be more or it could be less).. Assume cost of type 1 diabetes cure is $100K:. $100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 1.5 million current U.S. patients = $150B U.S. revenue. $100K (assumed treatment cost)  \* 9.1 million current global patients = $910B global revenue. But what about new cases of type 1 diabetes each year?. About 52,000 people in the US and 503,000 people globally are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year ([source](. $100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 52K new U.S. patients = $5.2B new yearly U.S. revenue. $100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 503K new global patients = $50.3B new yearly global revenue. Again, these are just ballpark estimates, but the point is that a type 1 diabetes cure is a MASSIVE on the order of $100B to $1T opportunity. Certainly a company like $SANA, which has a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands is worth more than a measly $654M market cap, even factoring in things like potential dilution (more on that in a bit).. What's even more mind blowing is that $SANA'S immune evasive tech unlocks all sorts of other currently impossible therapies. Any lab-grown cell or tissue therapy will need $SANA'S proven immune evasive tech in order to work. Companies developing things like lab-grown liver tissue or blood vessels may license $SANA'S immune evasive technology, or $SANA may simply develop the therapies themselves. Taken together, $SANA has the potential to grow into a massive company. A $1T valuation further down the line would not be out of the question if they play their cards right. The market opportunity they have is not just massive, but legendary in size.. **Investor concerns (and why you shouldn't be concerned)**. At the moment, there are 2 main concerns that $SANA investors have:. 1. $SANA is running out of cash. They only have 2-3 quarters of runway left. This is true; however, here's why you shouldn't be concerned. Quite simply, $SANA has monumentally good data, and a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands. As was just discussed above, the market opportunity is massive. So massive that investors will not let the company run out of money. Since the amount of money to be made is so large and the impact so great, someone will foot the bill to keep the lights on. It's just a question of who and how much they will invest. And what the investment will look like.. Some of the largest investors in $SANA are Arch Ventures and Flagship Pioneering, 2 of the world's largest biotech $VC firms. Neither of these VCs has sold much of their initial stake and are likely underwater on their positions considering $SANA launched with $700M in funding (more reason to not anticipate too much dilution) ([source]( Jeff Bezo's fund Bezos Expeditions is also an original $SANA investor. It might be an extreme example, but Bezos could invest $1B in $SANA like it's nothing (he's given several $100M donations to various people in the past, why not help realize a type 1 diabetes cure?). The point is, there are wealthy people who want to see a type 1 diabetes cure realized (and/or make money off it) and together will be able to fund $SANA'S continued operations, especially as long as their data is promising (and it is promising). $SANA will not go bankrupt, data and market opportunity is too good.. An interesting thought: Since you know $SANA has to raise money in the next 2-3 quarters, you can logically assume that a funding announcement will likely occur within 2-3 quarters. This is likely to be a positive catalyst as it will provide investors with clarity. As discussed in the next section, I don't expect significant dilution, which brings me to the next investor concern.. 2. $SANA will be diluted significantly. It's true that common methods of raising more funding for a biotech running out of cash involve dilution, but there isn't reason to expect that $SANA would be diluted significantly if it raises dilutive funding. Consider again how great the market opportunity for $SANA to address is. It's reasonable to surmise that there are many, many investors that are clamoring to invest in $SANA now, but there is only a limited number of investors that they will be able to take on. What happens when a deal is competitive? A bidding war ensues and the valuation of the company increases. Investors are willing to put the same amount of money into a company for less of a percentage stake.. Basically, because $SANA is so promising, any dilutiion from fundraising is likely to be minimal. In cases where a biotech startup is in a danger of going bankrupt, but has questionable data, dilution can be massive (e.g. on the order of 90%), but $SANA is a complete opposite situation. They may only be diluted  10%. Or they may not be diluted at all if they pursue a partnership that provides upfront payments in exchange for something like royalties. In an extreme case, they may get a donation. Let's say they were diluted 50% (this seems unlikely to me), the valuation would now be around $1.3B instead of $650M (assuming the price stays the same and number of shares double). It would still be a ridiculously low valuation compared to the opportunity discussed above.. There are a large number of funding possibilities for $SANA and competition among investors is likely to be fierce. Vertex would be interested in $SANA tech, but so would Lilly (who makes insulin and whose business will suffer once a type 1 diabetes cure is available). This brings us to the next consideration. What could $SANA be acquired for?. **What's a reasonable acquisition price for $SANA? ($10B minimum)**. To get straight to the point, probably at least somewhere around $10B. $SANA is an extremely promising biotech and extremely promising biotechs have recently been acquired for around $10B. You can look in the news for several examples ([example]( but you really don't need to look any further than Juno therapeutics, which was acquired for $9B in 2018 ([source]( Why do I highlight Juno therapeutics? Because many of Sana's leadership/founders are former Juno leaders/founders. In other words, they are experienced and have been through an acquistion before. They know how to play the game. Frankly, I would think $SANA would be worth paying even more than $10B to acquire. Their market opportunity will go far beyond type 1 diabetes.. **Ok, I'm sold. How should I play $SANA? (not financial advice)**. Buy shares and hold. Just buy and hold as many shares as you can as long as the valuation is under $10B. And even at $10B valuation, they could potentially be an even more valuable company, so I'd probably keep holding a stake then too. I've been buying shares since the all time low and my most recent purchase was at $2.63 (as you can see in the first screenshot above). I don't think it really matters what price you get the shares at now. The stock, in my opinion, is ridiculously undervalued. Perhaps it was shorted as people worried about it going bankrupt or the tech not working or dilution, but as described above, I don't think those are real concerns.. As always, none of this is financial advice. Do your own due diligence. Hopefully this is some helpful DD to get you started."
$SANA unequivocally has Type 1 Diabetes cure and is massively undervalued. The case for $10B+ valuation and 10-20X+ returns.
For a minute there I thought the ticker he was spamming was $SAVA and I had flashbacks.
"I am hopeful for $SANA too and own shares, but the caveats are that they have only presented one patient worth of data! That too, from an IIT and not a formal clinical trial. . They need more data and more patients! The IIT is being conducted in Europe. They may have trouble finding patients there because insurance and nationalized healthcare covers insulin and such. . Vertex, with a clearly inferior product (requires long term immune suppression and is injected into portal vein, depositing cells into liver), was able to get 12 patients worth of data and about 10 times as much press and attention!. If Sana can‚Äôt recruit patients and show more data, they will falter and fail! Operational execution is key!"
"So, I have some $SANA but I most certainly am not going to bet the farm on this.  My reasons for buying in a small list and not the wall of text I doubt anyone in this thread has the attention span to read.. Any stocks tied to diabetes are hot right now and fluctuate.. The research is interesting and will cause small spikes as news breaks. . The stock has return potential if you buy low and monitor it then get out. . Reasons I will sell as soon as I get a decent return.. Solving diabetes means no recurring prescription driving revenue . Other diabetes treatments are also proving to help with weight loss not necessarily with people who have diabetes. This company won't have that."
Only $SANA I care about is in TWICE.
$HIMS will do a better diabetes cure and they have revenue
"$SANA is at least 10 years away from any marketable product that will generate revenue for DM2. They haven‚Äôt even started Phase 1 trials for their DM2 treatment.

Yeah, if you get in now and hold you could have a big payoff in 10 years but this is not a get gains quick stock right now."

I‚Äôm bag holding $QCOM
"TL;DR - Reddit switched on machine translation for India on 28 Apr 2025, thereby exposing the world‚Äôs second-largest internet market to r/WallStreetBets. The chart above shows how $GOOGL is now funneling record numbers of new traffic (and thus new users) to Reddit.. India is a huge country. It doubles U.S. user counts on both YouTube and Facebook. Yet India is less than one-third the size of US users on Reddit. The upside here is thus enormous. If you overlay India‚Äôs early search-traffic curve on the launch-to-date growth for France, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, India is clearly sprinting past every precedent.. The model I created on May 13 assumed France-style adoption rates (the yellow projection line). The latest Semrush data shows India blowing through that benchmark (the white dotted projection line).. Add in the bullish Anthropic lawsuit, the now-GA dynamic product ads feature, and Reddit Answers traction, their current \~20% sh\*rt int\*r\*st is starting to feel a tad mis-priced."
This is partly because $GOOGL is now pushing Reddit links to the top when you $GOOGL something and also because many Insta pages started to steal memes from Reddit thereby causing people to end up here when trying to find the original source.
The question you should be asking is who exactly still uses $GOOGL for search in 2025? . Does India not get DeepSeek or chat gtp for free on their phones?
"Are the curves for Spain, Colombia, France, etc. based on their actual user numbers after Reddit enabled machine translation in those countries (not likely as they all align)? I'm guessing they have been normalized/adjusted to match India‚Äôs starting traffic level at the time of India‚Äôs $MT launch (April 28, 2025) - so just relative growth trajectories I guess.. I.e. the France/Spain/Colombia/etc. lines are  adjusted to start at the same traffic level India had when $MT launched on April 28, 2025. Are the benchmark country lines scaled to preserve their absolute growth amounts or their growth rates? For example, if Mexico grew from 5M to 10M post-MT (i.e., +5M), would the chart show that as 60M ‚Üí 65M (preserving growth amount), or as 60M ‚Üí 120M (preserving growth rate)?"

Every time I see $PLTR my heart aches. I had a shit ton around $20 and ended up selling after getting yanked around hard one year ü•≤ congrats though
Might be able to donor again today with $PLTR you know what‚Äôs better then One Million dollars?  It‚Äôs Two Million dollars.
It‚Äôs crazy people investing in $PLTR as if it‚Äôs not facilitating genocide
"I put 100k in $PLTR but sold $CCS, so no millon for me. I am rolling that shiet forever"
Coreweave in talks to buy $CORZ
$CORZ mooning $CRWV drilling. I demand $CRWV to 200
Gonna go all in on the $CRWV dip.
I wonder how far would $CRCL drop
"I can‚Äôt wrap my head around what these company do. But in anyway, do you think its a idea to buy some $CORZ shares beforehand?"
Thanks $CORZ
Tsla puts and straight into $TMCWW from there.. Thanks to my regarded homies.
Nice Job! $TMCWW has been cleaning up my SPY degeneracy the past few weeks lol
"Quick question from a noob: How‚Äôd you cover the cost of the $TSLA put? I was looking at them yesterday, but didn‚Äôt have the money to cover the option I wanted. ($300 @ Aug 25)"
$TMCWW is killing it. My portfolio is up 87% ytd thanks to it.
$TMCWW is going to keep going up!!!!
Let me guess. $COIN or $CAR
$TMCWW has been making great gains. ü§û
You heard of $TMCWW from Lemonade Stand by any chance

So what you‚Äôre saying is.. I should diamond hands my $HNGE calls
$BPT shares jump 7% on report it is in early-stage talks to be acquired by Shell
"I randomly bought some $BPT shares yesterday just because it went down when Israel and Iran ceasefire announced hoping it would bounce back up when tensions inevitably flare back up, seeing this was a nice bonus surprise"
"I got tired of holding $BPT and sold on Monday, lol."
"I bought it the other day, $BB is also UP, Ford is up, i might actually make it  OMEGALUL"
$NVDA semi momentum play
people flexing their puts here gives me so much more faith this actually plays out. have calls as well although August expiration. do you guys not see QQQ breaking ATH and DXY cratering? $NVDA been consolidating for an entire year. it‚Äôs time
$NVDA BOLS
"Folks, $MU is up almost 60% YTD, and my shares are still down 6% üíÄ"
i bought $MU puts and i am going to lose like 10k at open tomorrow its so cooked GG
I didn't realize it was possible to lose money on $AMD puts that's so weird
$CRCL bros are cooked beyond well done
"40mg of addy and a 12 pack of modelo deep right now. Smell like piss and haven‚Äôt shaved for days. $10,000 Aug1 $180 $GOOGL calls tmrw"

"The Trump Organization has removed a reference to the recently-announced $TE-WT smartphone being made in America.. The T1's webpage now has a reference to ""American-Proud Design."" The website says the device is ""brought to life right here in the USA.""  . LOL"
"I hate happiness, bought August puts on $NVDA today"
The real question everyone should be asking themselves is when is $UNH mooning though?
"Fellow $CLBR baggies, please show yourselves. It‚Äôs ok. This is a safe space."
Happy Wednesday to you all! Even to those stupid ‚Äútraders‚Äù who keep SELLING $CLBR STOCK!!! YOU are the WORST kind of trader there is and will end up in the poorhouse very soon!! If you don‚Äôt start buying back in TOMORROW I am going to be VERY UPSET!!! Major repercussions are planned!!  I‚ÄôM WATCHING YOU!!. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!!
If there's one thing I learned from Sesame Street it's that $OSCR belongs in the trash
$TSLA sub 300 on the horizon
"$NVDA is back at an all-time high, and this old fave is the biggest and the best. ‚Äî‚ÄîJim Cramer . It was a good run bols . But complete collapse inbound ‚ò†Ô∏è"
$NVDA single handedly holding up the SPY. Amazing
"$TSLA is a car company, playing an energy company, disguised as an AI company."
Every day the sheer volume of real human beings deciding to pay over $300 for a share of $TSLA mystifies me
"The year is 2036. . $NVDA has become the first $100T market cap company in history.. The $ is now a long-abandoned curiosity measurement, since its value cratered to be worth only 1% of itself between the years 2018 and the Great Rate Reckoning of 2025.. $NVDA is the last remaining private company with any access to clean water. Most of their operating expense goes to maintaining their elite private militia, responsible for killing anyone who tries to steal the water."
$MU. Puta madre. I have 50K in puts.
$MU. MUU. you fat cow what did you do to my puts
Can someone explain like what was the news that pumped $NVDA today? Like wtf?
Watch $MU take a huge dumb to $120 just because nothing makes sense after hitting multiple home runs.¬†
where is kk7766 when we most need him? $CLBR
Are you telling I‚Äôm a dumbass for selling 910 $NVDA shares at $144.72 that it‚Äôs gonna go to $300
$NVDA was $15 a share 3 years ago‚Ä¶
"So...$CLBR, huh?  Seems like a morally repugnant concept, but I do like money."
So many people bought the $HIMS dip...surely that will work out well...surely.
Reddit getting way too bullish on $GOOGL. Just because it‚Äôs undervalued doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôll. Moon
If $AMD hits $160 by next week my wife‚Äôs boyfriend promised to take me to Dairy Queen (I‚Äôm paying for everyone)
Fucking $NVDA thank god I have two months on my puts but still.
I'm a millionaire just for holding $NVDA shares rn lol. Pretty Surreal
"I think that once the 10 year is yielding 5% and $NVDA P/E is over 50, a lot more $NVDA shareholders will be asking really cool and interesting questions. Questions like ‚Äúhow many trillions of dollars worth of chips do we actually have to sell in the next 10 years to be worth this much right now? Really? That many? What‚Äôs the total earnings of all the other MAG7? How fast have they been growing earnings? Is there real Saudi demand? How much? Custom silicone? What‚Äôs that? Who is investing that much in custom silicone? Man that‚Äôs a lot. Is that more than we spend in R&D? How much money is there in the world? Like total amount of United States dollars? Wow I would have thought less than that.‚Äù"
I switched my $MU puts to calls because of how bullish it was in here I think I'm going to regret it
"Ok I said $MU would lower guidance and dump now I'm here to say I was wrong and I'm a loser. Recession canceled, fedex and general mills just suck eggs. Spy 700 EOY"
"$MU options buyers are about to learn what ""IV crush"" is tomorrow.. Options chain pricing in an 8.25% move into close, and here we are fading at 3.75%. *laughing toothless Mexican*"
man I can't help but feel like $GOOGL is such a good play
"4k shares of $CLBR @ 17avg, am I cooked is mango saving us"
$MU is one of the worst tickers I know.
No way they are paying out all the $NVDA calls that expire this week 1.7mil
Even $TSLA is pumping. You know it‚Äôs bad lol
Sad pathetic pump on $MU
My $AMD puts are down bigly. The likes of which no one has ever seen before. Some might say they're biggliest ever.
if $MU would have missed just one earnings metric it would be sub $100 now.
$MU what an absolute fuking disgrace
$SOFI could have hired a monkey off the street to read the prepared interview script their CEO is giving
$TSLA is the most regarded stock
"If $RDDT could open at $150 again, that would be great."
How screwed are my $NVDA puts expiring this week
"Just because you are from $TX and own a gun, that does not make you a veteran or active duty soldier¬†"
There's no way $NVDA gonna open this green.
Sorry about the $TSLA drop guys. I bought calls on Monday
Elon going to announce you can drive your Tesla with neuralink by December to pump $TSLA again.
Some people play $NVDA. Some prepare chicken nuggets.
$NVDA 7/3 PUTS?
Looks like my $NVDA 160 calls will be itm at open
Imagine not buying $NVDA when it was 90$ because ‚ÄúdEeP sEeK‚Äù
Manifesting $CRCL to 150 tomorrow üôè
is $GOOGL gonna tease us with another 180 push? (probably yes because i sold at 170)
"$CLBR is a win-win for this sub, we will either get to witness the wildest gain or loss porn of the summer. true degens will love the outcome either way once gain/loss is realized. so shit talk or hype to your hearts content everyone, the winners and losers will be decided in a mere few weeks, pick a camp and settle in for the ride!"
Let's go $MU üêÇ
"$NVDA is insane, bruh. Nothing's stopping that train. I just hope $AMD continues to bask in the reflective glory."
Those $MU numbers are damn good.
$AMD will be $160 tomorrow
$TSLA V?
"$MU Earnings:. - Revenue of $9.30 billion versus $8.05 billion for the prior quarter and $6.81 billion for the same period last year. - GAAP net income of $1.89 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share. - Non-GAAP net income of $2.18 billion, or $1.91 per diluted share. - Operating cash flow of $4.61 billion versus $3.94 billion for the prior quarter and $2.48 billion for the same period last year. ‚ÄúMicron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in $HBM revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year and reached a quarterly record, and consumer-oriented end markets had strong sequential growth,‚Äù said Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and CEO of Micron Technology. ‚ÄúWe are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we make disciplined investments to build on our technology leadership and manufacturing excellence to satisfy growing AI-driven memory demand.‚Äù"
$MU fighting for its life lmaooo
"NOW HALF YOU FOMO'ING SONS OF BITCHES ARE GOING TO YEET INTO $NVDA THINKING $200 IS COMING NEXT WEEK.. I mean, well, it could."
did my Robinhood Legend bug out or did $TSLA jump to 340 a bit ago?
puts on $ASTS
$NVDA puts lets do this
Krispy Kreme will soon be announcing they are scraping the McDonald‚Äôs expansion. $DNUT puts are gonna be my go to.

Damn that $MU fade big sad lmao

"$MU did not fool me, again. I try to learn lessons once."
Let $MU fall and buy it when it goes back up tomorrow
Holding my $TSLA 320 puts. Tomorrow I'll see you at the drive thru or you'll see me
"Seriously don't understand why anyone would even look at $MU.¬†. It's just memory. Samsung, Hynix, $LPL and pretty much every F-tarded Asian company can make it. If there's some special IP, they'll just copy it or the customer can simply add more memory that's little bit slower but a lot cheaper.¬†. Explain to me why.. Also, explain the price fizzle out from 6.5% to 0% in AH today, while at it.¬†"
If you think $MU tanking after earnings is bad. Just know I sold my entire position in $MU at $64 in April. Literally the pin point bottom. I can‚Äôt do anything but fucking laugh at myself.
Damn $MU options holders got rekt
"I've learned my lesson. Lost about 1k this week so far (I am a new trader) doing option calls on companies such as $UCO, $KTOS, and the most important 0DTE call option on QQQ.. Since the war started between Israel and Iran, I've chickened my way out of potentially great profit from $ASTS.. Today, i was very hopeful with my QQQ calls, but unfortunately, I've lost a big chunk of my portfolio. Regardless, the lesson was learned not to play with ODTE calls or puts. It's safe to say that my balls aren't that bigüòÇ.. So now I have a new plan of action. NO MORE SHORT CALL OPTIONS! Tomorrow, i will purchase a call option for $RKLB at the expiration date of 89 days. Slow and easy wins the race.. We are all here to make some extra cash, so I wish you all successful trading calls/puts/ or simply just holding shares until it reaches the moon!. Cheers"
$MU chart looking like a middle finger to my calls rn
"BUT CAN WE FINALLY GET SOME VOLUME ON $UNH, MAKE IT GO UP OR DOWN IDC ANYMORE AT THIS POINT.. GIVE . ME . VOLUME"
. wonder what that means for my $UNH bags..probably going to zero as is tradition
I bought $NVDA at 96 and sold at 98 looking for the 91 dip buy.¬† Clown hat please
$UNH - fast road to nowhere
She‚Äôs a 2 but buys $TMCWW calls
$UBER to $102
damn my $NVDA puts are cooked
I wanna see $TSLA dump 10%
"Sold my JUN27 $MSFT 492.5C for a $1.70ea on Tuesday, for like 150% profit thinking 'Nah, this shit gonna dump'.. Also unloaded half my JUL18 500C for a tidy profit.. The hindsight greed is tough"
$RDDT gonna moon again today? My loads are ready
Is $TSLA still fuk???
"Holy smokes! $NVDA, I hope I have thanked you enough!"
Was hoping for a war.   . Now stuck with $LMT and $RTX.
I unfortunately had to sell like 300 shares of $PLTR to buy myself a truck earlier this year cus I deserve it (and also mainly cus my 12 year old beater sedan was biting the dust) but damn do I wish I had 300 more shares of it rn üòî
". Brothers who see this picture, let's make $MMM together and fuck Ukrainian bitches LOL"
I sold a good bunch of $PLTR stock at about $15 to buy a house which ended up falling through. Watching the climb over the past year has been painful.
Is $PLTR already not too high?
. I think $IBKR has the answer for you
Get a shark loan and then double it or nothing on 3 $DTG Spy calls of $660 and by the power of Wall Street bets degeneracy you‚Äôll double your loss to 8k
Losing money on $CRCL. Got to the party when the punch bowl was emptied out
Try $MCTR + Z usually this helps.
Wait until you see $CRCL lol
"Puts before the 4th of July? RIP. Big Don ain't letting stocks go down, let alone $PLTR before Independence Day."
$HIMS to the moonüöÄü¶Ö
$HIMS to the moon then sells calls against it? Lol
What make $HIMS different?
$HIMS $25 coming to a RH chart near you
I‚Äôm short $MSFT here
"I see everyone calling you a retard or whatever. I think this is a reasonable gamble. $MSFT p/e is the highest it's been in the last 6 years. Generally it averages between 32-33, It's almost 40 now.   . As you said it's been on a tear since earnings and its due for a pull back. . My only feedback would be to maybe buy your puts in 3-4 blocks over the next few weeks, in case it stays flat for a while or has a bit of momentum still left. People saying things like moat and good management don't seem to understand that good stocks can be overbought and oversold as well. Between July 2024 - May 2025 $MSFT returned -23% because it was also previously overbought. . Good luck."
"While I don't disagree with you shorting $MSFT, why not sell call spreads?"
OP bought Puts at today's low of the day for $MSFT. He saw green for probably 5 mins max. It is now all red from here.
Betting against $MSFT is a foolish play.
I bought $MSFT 490P 7/18 when it was at $468.. still diamond handing but at this point i just accepted that its a lost cause lol my breakeven is $466.7
I‚Äôve been absolutely wrecked on 9/19 $MSFT puts at $400 and $380 purchased towards May EOM. . We‚Äôll see if it shows any weakness in the next few weeks but I‚Äôm exiting by July EOM if not.
"Stock market might be regarded right now but if the tariffs aren't lifted by taco (he probably will not until his trade deals are made which no one seems to even be fully cooperating for) then it is an inevitability for a decent correction. Microsoft isn't some unstoppable beast like people are making it out to be, sooner or later the tariffs WILL hit, and it'll be out of nowhere like every other economic slowdown has been like.. The way I see $MSFT, it's on a huge streak since its earnings because it's being viewed as a safe investment among the mania and it does feel safe considering it's only been going up since the earnings, but it is being very overbought like you said, and it will take just one bad day for people to get spooked out of buying it.. Honestly a good play and I think it'll print, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next week, but the market will slow down eventually as I do not see taco doing the signature taco move for tariffs. This stock is being priced as if we're in normal, uneventful times but we're not.. Also, I need a good entry for this dumbass stock so I am also praying this play will be the call of the month."
"Doesn‚Äôt matter how good $GOOGL is. If the market wants to go down, you‚Äôre going down with it."
We need more warriors like you. Bring $GOOGL back to all time high. Please
"Yes... because $PLTR should have died already next to $TSLA and this motherf....s keep going up, I swear nothing will make me more insane than some of these tickers...."
I agree with some comments. I would take profits too !  There are so many of you with $PLTR - retail trader who struck it big.  The stock is great but so overbought and traded.  The valuation is insane. I would think it would continue to climb slowly but I‚Äôve seen stocks sink overnight and ppl move on from the name - you think it won‚Äôt happen or that it can‚Äôt and boom . Just my opinion. But good trade. !! Congrats
now put it all into $SRFM if you have balls
What‚Äôs your opinion on a $PLTR OPTION?
"Whoever posted $TMCWW DD 2 weeks ago, I love you"
"Where are all the $TMCWW haters?üòÇ congrats! I‚Äôm still holding 1,000 shares plus 5 call contracts. Took profits on 500 shares and 25 call contracts. We are hitting $10 in a few days."
"John Oliver did a thing on this company a year ago and I have been watching it since. I can‚Äôt explain why I didn‚Äôt buy and hold between .90 and $2 but I am not willing to touch it now. Pretty sure this will go down with me also buying 1000 shares of $PLTR at $10 and selling at $9 because I had just started trading and thought I was going to lose all my money, lol."
$AMD - Diamond Hands? Nah. Lisa Hands‚Ñ¢
"Been investing in $AMD since I read the announcement that she was going to become the new CEO and that she was going to turn that business around, which she did. At that time, the stock was $7. She has proven that she was, is and has been a great CEO choice for $AMD"
"imagine having the money to buy $AMD calls, but not pic collage watermark removal üò≠"
I guess that when a stock earns a name like money destroyer it probably destroyed enough money to be worth buying.. $INTC here I come!
$AMD has been killing it. Good for them. I switched from Nvidia recently for my GPU so you're welcome by the way
I watched $RKLB go sideways for months and then sold at a slight loss. I watched it moon 26% this past week and felt like the Interstellar dude.
"""If you can't love me at my 85, then you don't deserve me at my 150."" - $NVDA"
"$CLBR CEO on today‚Äôs SPACInsider podcast said there‚Äôs no PIPE agreement which means no dilution upon ticker change to PEW. If redemptions are high, which I suspect they will be, then PEW could be trading with an extremely small float on ticker change day. I‚Äôm pretty sure $NMAX was in the same boat and it went $14 to $200 in the first few days. . This play is truly as regarded as it gets but I kinda am seeing the vision now."
Imagine being one of those regards that panic sold $NVDA during the tariff panic ü§°
"So when $NVDA was dumping a few months ago, price targets were in the toilet. Now that it's pumping, price targets are mooning. I think analysts are just regarded momentum traders."
$ASTS back down to $20 hopefully so I can miss getting back in again
$ASTS is really gonna rebound from -8 to green in just a few hours üöÄ
just a friendly reminder to anyone not feeling fomo that $NVDA is almost up 100% from reciprocal tariffs low LOL
damn someone just fast-forward me to $CLBR merger so I know if I'm up $500K or down $50K
AI is propping up the market. I wonder if we'll get a 2000 dotcom-style crash when we finally figure out that getting to $AGI will be harder than we thought.

I buy $NVDA puts one time and goes straight up
$NVDA on the brink of ATH and most of tech green and moving upwards but SPY is absolutely struggling to keep from dropping like a rock is truly something. I should just start playing individual tickers instead of SPY these days
"I‚Äôve seen some drawn out distribution stages before, but this one takes the cake. The institutions just rigged the market for nearly 2 and 1/2 months so they could unload their shares to the dumbest of retail participants right below $ATHS."

"$NVDA has had an erection lasting longer then 4 hours, should we be concerned?"

$GOOGL and $AMD pumping? You had a good run bols but this is a bad sign for the overall market.
Of course I sold $AMD at $95.. Just another paper handed fuck of a decision.

"Holding $KALV stock is a bet on strong science overcoming political noise. The company's core asset, Sebetralstat, has shown strong and unequivocal clinical data in its Phase 3 trials, indicating a high probability of approval on a scientific basis. The drug is positioned to be the first and only oral, on-demand treatment in a multi-billion-dollar market, creating immense upside potential. Furthermore, reports that the FDA's scientific body defended the application signal confidence in the data, and the company is well-funded to weather the current storm. For an investor with a high risk tolerance, the asymmetric risk-reward ratio makes holding the position a compelling speculative opportunity."
"Good luck man. I put 95% of my IRA with Robinhood into CSPs on $NMRA and lost my ass. I own 4,000 shares at a cost of $7.5/ea and they‚Äôre worth ~80¬¢ each now. Biopharm is dangerous business."
Bought SPY calls last Friday Iran decides to pop off eating away my confidence all weekend. Panic sold my calls in Robinhood first thing Monday but decided to hold onto the calls in SoFi. Sold those the next day at a 6k profit and rolled it all into $RDDT calls. Sold off those this morning. . 
SPY calls into $RDDT calls +$20k

Went all in last year in $AMD with an average of 135. Down 50% few months ago but averaged down along the way and Finally broke even today. Not selling till it hits 500 and this position turns 5M in 2026. Initial post: . 
What a retard‚Ä¶ no one cares if your portfolio diversity is 100% $AMD. You act like there hasn‚Äôt been more retarded portfolio diversifications in here.
Honestly $AMD has legs to go higher. I‚Äôm just trading it so I have Jan 2026 calls.
You think $AMD will be 500 by 2026?!
What is $AMD doing for it to go up?
"I cashed out, been burned by $AMD too long lol."
Im also buying $AMD here i hope it goes up like nvda
This will be my $AVXL options soon

"$GOOGL is one of the best Mag7 plays. . - Gemini and everything generative is absolutely on point. And $GOOGL is an actual business that cares about costs per token so they are spending on this with some thought to ROI. . - Waymo is a leader. - Cloud. - Gmail/Sheets and all potential AI interactions. - YouTube is silly big. $GOOGL is a great opportunity, IMO."

"I think spreads are fine, but go for 5-10% returns every 20 days and close those at 40-50% gains and open again, on 45m-2h Bollinger Band alerts. I'd use strikes that are far ITM with 85% or greater chance of success. Small gains over and over and over. I made around $260K on $MSTR, $NVDA, $SMCI doing this in last 12 months but had a very hairy experience with $SMCI that took forever to recover from using bull put spreads. . In the meantime wait for expiry and roll?"
I am 23 years old and I recently went to rehab and took classes for my mental health.. I was recently a gambling addict and i currently am in debt 100k from taking out personal loans and credit cards. I am now working 100 hour weeks and have payment plans to pay off the debt within 4 years. I have a 3 year old son and I have had a lot of mental breakdowns on how I now am going to lose time spending with him due to me working overtime to pay off my ridiculous debt. It was idiotic and I have learned from my decisions and I am looking to move forward with my life and never ever touch gambling again.. it is going to be a long couple of years to get there with 100 hour weeks. I am coming here to ask any of you to possibly help me move forward.

"After clapping myself -$35k trying to day trade, I finally have no more money to deposit into my account to meet the $25K PDT requirement so I yolod it into $BULL. Moon after June 30th. Am I regarded? Yes, but the ticker is literally BULL"
$19K $BULL YOLO DD
"Just a word of advice from a fellow $BULL long, in September a bunch of locked shares open up so make sure you dump the $20/25 calls if you are up before then. Might see a big sell off around then"
Woulda done better with $HOOD. Sheesh.
". This is after a successful play on $AMD.. I'm all in on $GOOGL. Pray for me, brothers!"
My biggest YOLO [150k on $GOOGL calls]
And this is why my $GOOGL shares aren‚Äôt up
My stomach sank when I saw the title of this post‚Ä¶.. I have pretty much my whole portfolio in 650 shares of $GOOGL
Feel like I‚Äôm living under a rock. Why is everyone so bullish on $GOOGL on short term calls?
$GOOGL will likely be down 6% tomorrow
"You went calls on $HIMS. Definitely a degenerate like me. No due diligence because you would‚Äôve known GLP-1 (which is their money maker) is no longer allowed to be compounded, they lost partnership with their main GLP-1 provider because they keep selling their compounded ones, and all the other stuff they sell (hair pill, dick pill, etc) are also sold by a lot of other companies like Blue Chew, etc. They haven‚Äôt made any pivot so why would you give them that amount in a short period of time?. I digress, back to regarded behavior"
I bought $GOOGL calls today also gl
"$CLBR. $GOOGL. $HIMS. One of us, one of us!!"
"If everyone who is long $GOOGL also buys Germini subscription, the stock would go up üòÇ"

$HIMS calls ain‚Äôt looking so good there chief

is there any way i can get involved in $GOOGL calls from the UK?
"$GOOGL has very serious risk. This shit isn't just a knee jerk dip. $GOOGL basically dominated searches. Now, people use ChatGPT/Grok, whatever a ton. If you want to buy something unfairly beat up, it's probably $UNH."
Too many autists on the $GOOGL yellow bus.. Your calls will expire worthless
My original investment in 2000 $QSEP stocks finally is green again.
I remember when I bought $QSEP at $10 and sold at $40 only to see it run up to $100. Good times!
For months and months $AMD was the shittiest stock. Now $AMD is pumping and $GOOGL is the shittiest stock LMAO
QQQ - Up 1.5%. $AAPL - Down 0.6%. Guess which one I full ported
I‚Äôm laying here next to my gf who I just railed and all I can feel is nothing because $FDX destroyed the last of my money.
"I‚Äôm not falling for $AMD again. Fool me seven times, shame on me"
I personally don't think $CRCL dropped enough today. How about another -15%?
Bro can these scumbags just pump $UNH to 310 tomorrow so i can dump these bags...for fuks sake
Cathie sold $CRCL at $263 after acquiring the shares at the IPO. Even Cathie is making money these days

$RDDT mooning AH. . Source: I shorted it Lmaoooooooo
$GOOGL and $ADBE are undervalued currently.. Hop in boys we're going to the top!. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!
The lack of $RDDT talk around here is a classical presentation of regardedness.
I stopped being a bitch and finally went all in on $ASTS this morning. So yeah there is a great chance this is the top.¬†
Who gave $AMD a Moonstone and made it evolve from Advanced Money Destroyer to Advance Money Distributer?
"‚ÄúMommy, how did we get so poor?‚Äù. ‚ÄúYour dad is regarded and bought $GOOGL calls at the top‚Äù"
Just remember some regard bought $CRCL at 298
Shorting $AAPL again because it always works 9 out of 10 times
"Sooo, $CRCL is, when you dig down on what they really are, a company that really just profits from the interest from holding U.S. treasuries.. LOL"
$AAPL is such a huge piece of shit. Thank you for your attention to this matter
$AAPL really gave up on life the last hour.
Probably going to sell my $ASTS. Feels like its going to go up forever. Daily chart is straight up for 16 days.
Everyone talking about $BB. During Covid I bought the 1/20/2023 $7 strikes for $3.25/each. Bought 30 contracts. Sold them within 4 weeks for $24/EACH. . Those were the days
Time for $CRCL to get it's own bagholder subreddit now
I was told $CRCL would be the most valuable company in the world. I feel misled üòû
"What on earth is going on with $ASTS Space Mobile? This stock just goes up 10% every day, for the last 3 weeks."

$NVDA you absolute fucking slut
"$ASTS, another day another ATH"
4k of $CRCL puts at close!
Are my $AAPL calls gonna print ? Most likely not so congrats to any fucks that have puts
If I could place a banbet it would be $CRCL 165 72hrs
$HIMS is the buy of the century
$AMD flying back to ATH
"I never doubted you, Lisa Su!. Except for all of those months in which $AMD was absolute dogshit."
"Who bought $CRCL at the top, be honestü•¥"
"I‚Äôm long $AMD rn, but yall are about to invoke the curse of Su with all this bullish $AMD talk"
The amount of people in here hoping that $CRCL will go back up after a 800% run in two weeks is crazy. Yall really thought this shit wasn‚Äôt coming down?
Has $GOOGL tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?
bro what are these $AAPL Cash ads that are specifically targeting against Venmo ü§£ü§£ü§£
"When $PLTR crashed to single digits, I had an ordered typed in to buy 500 2 yr leaps that were like $1-$4 each due to being ridiculously out of the money. I decided against it but it would have made me a multi millionaire. Can‚Äôt dwell on that shit. Sucks, but that‚Äôs the game we play."
"That reminds me of when I swung a $SMCI call 3 weeks out, with my last $400 and sold it the following day because there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs gonna keep going up, right? RIGHT? . 3 weeks later it was clocking $38K. I cried..a lot"
"I had an $MU play like that, it killed me!! I played $MU many times, mostly made money, lost a couple times, then they finally broke out & I missed it!!. Whatever tf i bought instead lost $, wanted to scream!!"
"Meta in 2022, Pltr ....next up is $GOOGL. Look forward, don't look back. That's already done"
Was reading a spy novel written a couple years ago. One of the subplots they were using $PLTR to track someone through OSINT‚Ä¶.bored wife and friends going on about their capabilities bought some of the stock ($12) it was so interesting (not enough of course) never gonna sell.
"Win some and lose some, and live to trade another day. Imagine how I feel, I bought $PLTR back in the day, about 1500 shares, and sold all at about $15. Wish I would have held on, lol."
"Tomorrow when you trade SPX again, look at the VIX, $VOLD and $ADD before"
"And then I tellz them I‚Äôm going to take picturezzz and I‚Äôll seez you in a few monthzzz. We‚Äôll, here we are, a couple of months after the tarifs shit show and as expected, the retards are still eating peanuts with their nutshells in order to have more nutrients, while $RKLB is on the cusp of heading higher, making me a lot richer. Keep in mind I‚Äôm europoor so this is taking into account the -15% devaluation of the $ against the ‚Ç¨. Stay strong retards you can do it to, you just have to stop being retarded  . "
"$RKLB , $LUNR and $ASTS were the best bets someone could have bet his fortune"
Some people call me a space cowboy (im all in on $RKLB AND ASTS)
"Ahaha no way, a fellow $RKLB holder! I‚Äôm new here, but gladly bought back when it was a SPAC. Literally purely based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation. Dealt through the hard year+ and am happy with where I‚Äôm at now üòä. I‚Äôve also made some bad investment decisions btw‚Ä¶ this is one of my best."
I'm currently flying on $ASTS.  When do I pull the trigger??
Lmao I knew $RKLB was heavily involved based on the chart
I bought calls last year when it was $12 and it went up to like $38 eventually. Sold for like $25K profit. Then it went back under $20 again after. Definitely sell man. Bth $ASTS and $RKLB have cycles.
"so since this option is in the money, can you sell it **NOW**  for $4,776 profit?. so what if by 1/16/26 the price of $ASTS is still $52.75, and you don't sell? then this option will expire worthless am I right? and you don't get anything in return"
My $GOOGL put yolo gonna print tmr.
$HOOD gainzü¶ÖüöÄ
"I love $HOOD, to the moon!"
"Steel in general is beat up at the moment. 24% gain is good. . I like $MTUS a lot, and see huge upside for $CLF once it gets turned around(LG‚Äôs a loud mouth)ü§£ü§£"
I already had some arguments with people on here about it. Doesn‚Äôt matter though cause $TSLA will still go up so just buy calls I guess
"$TSLA FSD more murderous than Ted Bundy? Already priced in,. Believe it or not, calls. everyone knows $TSLA is a sex robot company anyways wtf do cars have to do with the stonk. Thank you for your attention to this matter"
"Weirdly people are not buying pony.ai which shows great advancement in the robotaxi line. With contracts from China main cities with real evidence of it testing through busy traffic and advance technologies and, UAE and now going to Singapore and Malaysia. When $PNYG really starts going . It's a no brainer now to buy the dip"
$COIN $CRCL PUTS YOLO
$CRCL is valid but coin is crazy to put
Way too early and volatile to go for this. Good luck nonetheless. When you see people posting losses on $CRCL puts that's your buy puts signal
"Godspeed man. I follow you on $CRCL, put in an order at 6.0, not sure if it is gonna hit. When it rains it pours."
"Yeah think your timing will be off on COIN. They are predicting Genius and Clarity Act passing through congress in August. Look at the bounce the stock just turned off Genius Act getting through only the Senate. Firm believer we will see a run up finally breaking 400 sometime in Aug/Sept. COIN will also have an earnings report around Aug 7th. Don‚Äôt forget like 50% of $CRCL profits fall in COINs pocket. How far it will go I dunno, but hoping we at least see some stabilization for a period in the 400s is my prediction over the next few months. . I‚Äôm a LT straight stock holder with 5800 shares that I‚Äôve had for around 2-3 yrs now. This stock is going to get me to retirement."
$CRCL puts seem like as much of a sure thing as you could get but I am too poor
I'm in on $CRCL but have to wait for market open tomorrow.
$CRCL ok but why coin
"crazy putting COIN tbh. $CRCL you might have a case but COIN is crazy. Not in favor of SPY but it's your call. Market goes up by nature, I wouldn't waste my money shorting markets"
"I actually got 10k in $100 7/18 put, but COIN put is a no from me dawg. If $CRCL goes up more then I'll prob buy more $100 8/15 put"
Too early for $CRCL puts but god speed. Edit: circle puts that low*
Happy $UNH dividend day guys

0 $DTG puts if ya feeling cray
$GLD has anal gaped me. The good news is my calls are until 2026.
Having everything tied up in $CLBR hurts. Missing the gaynz.
"I‚Äôm starting a company called A Strategy Strategy, ticker symbol ASS. I‚Äôm going to continuously issue shares and buy $MSTR with the proceeds."
Just realized $CLBR reads as Caliber which will merge into PEW. They went for peak meme energy.
$ASTS hitting 100 this year easy
$TSLA is down simply because i have calls ... POS stock fr
That feeling when your up more than 1000% on $ASTS and every single fucking DAILY gain is as high as your initial investment :)
"Waymo: hundreds of actual autonomous taxis that work. *I sleep*.

$TSLA red. $AMD green. Is this the end of the world?
how many days in a row is this for $ASTS. crazyyyyy
"Ngl i knew i shoulda taken the 170 percent profits on $CRCL yesterday but i just trimmed instead of selling it all. Greed boys, greed"

"$GLD bulls, time to buy dip?"
$CRCL is circling the drain!
"$TSLA providing FSD to Israeli, U.S., and Iranian missiles for targeting. . $TSLA robotaxi services for mobile missile launchers as well.  . Up for 5,000%"
Your Tesla turning into a decepticon and sleeping with your wife? Not priced in and $TSLA goes up
calls on $TSLA
Only thing not priced in is Elon running for President in 2028. This would be +100% on $TSLA. So from $1K to $2K at this point.
"Yeah whatever I‚Äôm still holding $CL long till at least $80, I won‚Äôt be dissuaded."
"The quality of posts in this place are why $RDDT continues to tank to oblivion.. I mean... haha, so funny bro, do a chart go right ""prediction"" joke next"

Got Rekt yesterday with $HIMS
"better take it and run, they lost big time with their best selling partnership. Bet you it was triggered by someone on $HIMS side with a big chip on their shoulder."
Absolutely loaded $GLXY calls. I think the Coinbase and $CRCL rallies will fuel a rotation into this recent IPO. Rate my position
Sorry about your losses. THIS IS THE NEXT $NKLR LUNA. Does nothing but go down EVERY DAY!
Sold my previous $CLBR shares and bought $NBIS dip yesterday at 45 
$NBIS gains
"Did $CLBR hit a predefined stop-loss you had, and did you have a signal for $NBIS or are you just vibing on tech stocks"

$ASTS full port
"Update to my past post: [. I am doubling down on my last position because of a few things: . \-CTX320 data expected in the next week; gene editing for Cardiovascular disease. \-**A company with a similar program was acquired by Eli Lily for $1.3B** last week, leading to acquisition rumors for $CRSP Tx and providing confidence in their approach as well as gene editing overall ([Verve Tx Buyout](. \-FDA is seeking to cut red tape to fast track approvals in cell and gene therapies¬†([RFK looks to slash red tape](. \-Short interest still at \~25%. \-Institutional ownership at \~75%. Position: . [7\/18 45C seem like a layup, adding more on dips](. "
$CRSP Tx - Catalyst anticipated this week
"Update here from One Big Beautiful Bill for those who care: . \-The bill has provisions for Orphan drugs, which say that Medicare can't negotiate on price (CRISPR's one approved drug treats two different orphan diseases), so they will get the full $2.2M list price. \-Biotechs benefit from the R&D tax deduction provision as well. This makes them more attractive for acquirers who can deduct the biotech's losses on their taxes. $CRSP has close to $1.5B in losses over the last decade, so if they get acquired someone can write off that loss (at 21% tax rate that is \~$300M). . Hypothetically their value is the DCF + cash + operating loss tax deduction. They have $1.9B in cash and $300M tax shield. At a $4.5B market cap they still seem too cheap."
$CRSP enters Russell 3000 June 27th. You have that catalyst too.
"Been buying since last year and adding 80% of my pay each month, upwards of 5.5k a month till I own 0.01% of google. . I wanna name my gravestone ü™¶ have $GOOGL embossed W gold ü™ô."
$GOOGL will be my retirement ticket üé´
It is just like Microsoft in 2012.. $GOOGL is a money machine.
"F it, I‚Äôll double down today on my 2026 Jan calls. there‚Äôs just no fucking reason for a random 5% drop. No other mag stock gets hit from bogus headlines like $GOOGL."
"For $GOOGL, I always picked up 5-10 shares when it dipped under 165, and 5-10 more for every $5 dip below that.  From last September till now, I have built it from 0 to almost 100 shares with average cost in 150s, lol.. It seems it always goes forward 3 steps, and then back up 2.9 steps."
"PEOPLE FORGET $GOOGL WAS $3,000+  BEFORE THE STOCK SPLIT A FEW YEARS AGO"
110% agree. I just keep DCA into $GOOGL
$GOOGL WTF
This and $UNH are my two favorite long holds
I would normally be super bullish on $GOOGL right now but seeing all you regards sharing the same opinion isn‚Äôt a good sign
"Also a leader in Quantum, neck and neck w $IBM. $IBM has grown a ton based on their position in the field, crickets on $GOOGL tho."
"There's so much under the hood of Goog, they have many assets beyond search, it's a cash cow and will probably continue to generate tons of cash, since the searches that drive the most revenue for $GOOGL probably are still pretty useful when googling, most of the crap I use LLMs for are deeper research or understanding, not so much buying things or looking for a lawyer or doctor. Still very early innings. Plus they have so many levers to pull and tweak to keep generating tons on üí∞üí∞üí∞"
$GOOGL will be at 175 for the next 30 years¬†
"Going down amigo, ChatGPT taking over. . Feds Anti-trust lawsuit and selling off chrome. . $AAPL might cancel the search deal then or renegotiate.. Aws and azure eating gcloud‚Äôs lunch."
Why buy $GOOGL instead of GOOGL? You don‚Äôt want voting rights?
That‚Äôs $200M right? 0.01% of $GOOGL. . You‚Äôre not making it.
$AMD gonna fuckin pop. $200 this year
Why $GOOGL over any other?
$GOOGL need a snakeoil-type salesman like elon and the stock will easily go up to $300
Bet ya 5k that $AMZN beats $GOOGL. You won‚Äôt.
"It better be. If you're the dude who bought 130K in $GOOGL calls, and if that is 80% of your investment portfolio, then Wendy's will come calling if those calls don't come through."
Might take my $PLTR gains and go into $GOOGL
"Damn I liked $GOOGL too, but after seeing the attention it's gotten here in the last few days, no wonder it's dropped.."
One of us Masochists!!! I own $AMD and GOOG!!!
"Working in SEO and actually dealing with them..... Naw dog, this ain't it, $GOOGL is a clown show these days.. Run a set of searches on DuckDuckGo, Bing, and $GOOGL. . Then run a set of questions on ChatGPT and Gemini, you'll see how far $GOOGL has fallen."
ChatGPT gonna single handedly wipe out $GOOGL
$GOOGL might die with ai. Have you heard of perplexity ai?
$GOOGL search is dead take the loss and get out
$GOOGL is the worst tech company to buy right now. Literally any other is way better
"dude $GOOGL is so done. I did an analysis on them recently and unpacked that ~85% of their revenue comes from their original products which were invented over 20 years ago. They could have just kept Search and YouTube and routed all profits to shareholders, and their value would possibly be higher."
Ah yes $GOOGL with YouTube being its best asset and also making basically no revenue
$GOOGL yolo.. 1/3rd done 2/3rd left
I pray you win big cause if you win big all my shares that have not moved for the past year and a half will go up as well.  But yeah...not a move I would make having watched my shares go nowheres in 2 years.  Did you make this move on some news we don't know? LOL  Anyways fair thee well investor!  May we finally get some winds on the $GOOGL stock blowing it in the right direction.
Agree this is going up. But just don't know when. :) I'm also long on $GOOGL and had it since 150ish. Good luck to us all.
I don't know how to make money on $GOOGL
All logical thinking and analyses point to $GOOGL being significantly undervalued. So it will continue to underperform because WSB overwhelmingly loves it.
$GOOGL is the new intel.
15% of my portfolio is in $GOOGL.
Didn‚Äôt know $GOOGL can be an asset for margin.
Someone in this group recently called $GOOGL a hunk of shit and I don‚Äôt think they could have been more accurate. I finally sold all mine
"I am all in on $HIMS. My view is that this is an overreaction as outlined by the $HIMS CEO on X (. This is still a company growing at more than 100% per year at 40x forward earnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across the board, so I don‚Äôt believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3 years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with $HIMS continuing to be a retail favorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significant discount. Could it go lower? Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quite good.. Disclaimer: Not financial advice . I am not a financial advisor. In fact, I can barely advise myself. This post is for entertainment purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities. Any resemblance to financial wisdom is purely coincidental."
$2.3m $HIMS yolo
Yo OP did you hedge with puts? Last time $HIMS dropped 30% it dropped 20% next day
A halfway decent marketing campaign from $AMZN pharmacy and $HIMS goes discount bin until it gets bought up. Just my $0.02.
"I want to invest in $HIMS but I cant get past the Mass Compounding accusations from Novo.. How do you feel about the claim of Mass Compounding?  If a drug is short supply the FDA allows pharmacies to compound a patient tailored dosage pharmaceutical currently under patent. However the FDA already ruled that $GLP 1 is no longer in short supply and all three $GLP 1 receptor drugs are under Patent until 2030.. Pharmacy/Telehealth companies like BlueChew are able to compound Viagra (generic Sildenfil) because the drug is generic, is a unique dosage and does not hold a New Drug patent with the FDA."
$HIMS will be a dead company in five years !remind me 5 years
"The dip in $UNH is irrational, but this one, idk man. Suppose it turns out they are cutting pills together with low quality meds from China lmao, it would be so over"
People love to short $HIMS. It was a good day for them
If you wanted to throw away 2.$MMM you could‚Äôve just given it to me
"this is the best trade to make with $2M ? . This is your money . I would put it into Stanley Black and Decker . sell 300 $60 strike puts ($480) per contract Jan expiration. take the $144,000 and buy $HIMS  shares"
Some bullish retard was going on about this stock last week. I bought puts the moment I saw their stupid $HIMS post. LMAO ü§£
"Feel that the drop today was an overreaction. Scaled light into $HIMS today, up on it currently. Nowhere near the amount you dropped though. Best of luck!"
"Bweh, can't see future for them after losing $NVO. something very shady is going on. Those accusations aren't light.."
$HCAI ‚úÖÔ∏è üé´
First mistake was trusting the $HIMS CEO üòÇ
Does anyone know if $HIMS or $AMZN pharmacy have plans to be able to provide controlled substances. This seems like one area that traditional pharmacies still have the edge in.
$AMZN is launching their own subscription based health service. I wonder how it will affect Hims.
I'm looking at $HIMS here as well because they can just continue to use the compounds for much less money and expand their profit margins
Space waffles everyday $ASTS
"What stocks are at good entry points long term $GOOGL, Lunr, BBAI?"
$HIMS | $19.5k in 3 Minutes!!!
Where is that guy who YOLO $HIMS 2x?
How'd you know where to put $HIMS in?
If you had $HIMS on your watchlist you would have seen it was down a lot pre market. I first saw it down at like 8 am. Immediately went to stock twits to see why and saw the $NONOF news. I didn‚Äôt have the powder to pick up puts at open but i was eyeing the 6/27 $40‚ÄôS they were 5 cents. Not hard to have made some money on the momentum upon market open
"Somehow someone recommended me $HIMS. For no reason at all, a few days ago. Meh. Fingers crossed $MDBH takes off."
. üåï $BULL
how do you lose on a stock like $ASTS
Only $ASTS loser alive rn...
"$ASTS is for owning shares and LEAPS, otherwise gg"
You will be fine $ASTS will go down to the shitter. They have no revenues and they will need to dilute again. Hold on you will be rewarded
"$AMD will be fine, definitely would‚Äôve given yourself a few more weeks though. $HIMS is cooked, cut those losses and roll it into $AMD. $AMD will be the biggest winner this year and next."
"$HIMS won't recover this week, at least very unlikely. $AMD is a good bet,...Good luck"
My $HIMS puts would be cooked if yours hit. Good luck to you and your marriage!
I also got the $HIMS dip.
$HIMS is done
$HIMS is surging. Those will pan out
Don‚Äôt listen to these idiots about $HIMS I bought a bunch of shares today but again they‚Äôre shares so
"I have the same bets, $AMD and $GOOGL. . We can't both be retarded, right?"
The volume on $HIMS calls today was ridiculous.
"$AMD calls, not bad. $HIMS tho. oh boy you better strap in"
"I sold you one of those $CLBR calls. I own shares and have problems taking profits so I sold covered calls to take profits in tranches. Good luck my friend, I think you are also cooked"
And might have a chance‚Ä¶ $HIMS is cooked.
"$HIMS is done, going to follow Beyond Meat and Moderna to the bottom"
His $AMD looks fine. Edit: lolnvm didn't see where all the contracts were at. ü§£
$AMD ain't it brother
Might work. I‚Äôm big on $AMD this year but who knows by your exp ha
Oh dear‚Ä¶GOOG will help‚Ä¶.and $HIMS has a shot (the book is hopeful.) Maybe roll and consolidate? Good luck OP.. (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll add FOBI to the watchlist‚Ä¶.)
"$AMD calls still sounds reasonable, but I have a feeling $HIMS might test lower levels."
Well your $AMD printed
Did $AMD save u?
"Damn man. Why these stocks? $AMD consistently loses people money and $HIMS just had their worst day ever‚Ä¶hope it works out for you but damn. And all these different plays, expirations, I mean Jesus, really over complicating it for yourself."
$HIMS.US plunges over 17% in pre-market trading after reports emerge that Novo Nordisk has terminated its collaboration
$NVO is also down 5% premarket. Wonder what happened.
"NOVO‚Äôs management is absolute garbage. They keep disappointing, and are shit at communication. . And in under a month they stopped their collaboration with $HIMS, on things that were known before they made the deal. . Plus they fired their CEO without even having a replacement ready."
"Ozempic is so last year any way they made this new shit called Retatrutide and it‚Äôs like 500% better I‚Äôm down 10 fucking pounds in a week, literally just haven‚Äôt eaten, don‚Äôt even want to. . Anyway friendship ended with $HIMS sketchy grey market compounder friendship beginned"
$HIMS should be down 50% shortly after their primary source of upside accused them of being criminals.
"""Thanks for the free customer acquisitions, $HIMS....adios."" -Novo"
So is Novo upset because $HIMS are putting ‚Äúpatient safety at risk‚Äù or upset because $HIMS are offering a more cost effective alternative that would take market share from Novo?
I think there is a good chance $NVO went into this partnership knowing they‚Äôd rip the rug from under them eventually. They were none too pleased with that Super Bowl ad and I‚Äôm sure they got a decent amount of people started on sema
"god damnit, $HIMS was carrying my portfolio for a while, this is a huge L, yall think it will come back? time to buy?"
"It was back to $55? Wow i bought some when it was around $20 late last year because of some regard here saying that it was going to be bought by $AMZN and whatnot, but i chickened out and sold when it fell from $60 to $50 a few months ago. Then it went back to $20 something and i felt like Buffett."
"imagine buying short-term puts last week that didn't expire last week but expired this week instead... this kind of huge swings rarely happens, but it shows the importance of time premium sometimes. I scalped $HIMS last week but didn't buy any puts to hold over the weekend lol, sadge"
"Good. I dislike them not because of their high prices, but they promised discreet packaging. I dunno how discreet it is when $HIMS is right there on the return address. Add to the fact they're doing a shit ton of advertising¬†"
Would have though this was bullish for $NVO plus it's only been collaborating for a month but whatever.¬†
$HIMS 260k gain in 2 days
"First the $UNH guy now this guy.. That you're insider trading is one thing, that you are proudly posting it on here is another. That's some big hope they'll never investigate."
this is paper trade lol. $IBKR highlights the numbers in simulated trading
Peak comedy was when some Ber bought $60K of $TSLA puts yesterday and wrote a text wall of highly retarded analysis only for the $TSLA stock to go up 8% today. I can't stop laughing at this shit
"TODAY WE CARRIED OUT A $POCI STRIKE AGAINST SPY, $TSLA AND $OXY PUTS. ALL STRIKES WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THE SHORTS OF BEARS WERE COMPLETELY AND TOTAL OBLITERATED. IF BEARS ATTACK OUR MARKETS IN RESPONSE IT WILL GET MUCH WORSE!. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER."
$130K $GOOGL call bro fuk. $60K $TSLA put bro bigly fuk all in one day. RIP in peace bros
You have better chances betting against the United States of America than you do against $TSLA bro what the fuck is this thing
"Between USA, Iran and Israel, the only casualty seems to be $GOOGL."
$CLBR LAST DISCOUNT üö®üö®üö®
Let me guess. $GOOGL dumps 5% again at open and $TSLA moons
"$TSLA, missing it‚Äôs revenue: +10%. $TSLA, robotaxi shenanigans: +10%. I do not understand this stock anymore."
$GOOGL down 8% in a week. Surely this is an easy 8% gain right?
Need $HIMS to hit 30 so I don‚Äôt feel bad for missing it all those months ago
Whats up with all these bots pushin $GOOGL on us
Objectively $AMZN deserves $300 per share
$HIMS really just had a -35% on almost 200 million volume lmao
"$ASTS on a generational run these past few weeks, sending people into retirement every hour."
"Is it insider trading if you're the CEO of Novo Nordisk and you bought puts on $HIMS before picking a fight in public? If no, I have no idea why the CEO didn't just load up on $HIMS puts before."
Now we just need a ceasefire with $GOOGL
"If I had bought $CRWV $CRCL $ASTS $RKLB $OSCR a month ago, I would have retired but here I m with $AAPL and $GOOGL."
Someone out there lost their life savings on a $HIMS yolo
$CLBR -üíéüíé hands
-It was a huge pump that night.. -How big was it?. -It was so big that even $GOOGL was green.. -Holy fuck.
$GOOGL must be one of the most hated stocks in the Wall Street the way it‚Äôs being treated LMAO
Bought $AMD and $GOOGL on the same day a few months ago. $AMD  +40%. $GOOGL +.5%
"$CRCL only up 9.6% today, one of their worst days in history."
Waymo? More like I need to buy waymo calls on google because $TSLA robotaxi only had 4 accidents in a 10 hour period during the public test with safety drivers in the cars
"Down $20K today, thanks $HIMS"
"God! Please give $HIMS +10% day, and I‚Äôll never touch options again! . Today options today after 2 months was the most regarded mistake even !. Please god please please üò≠"
$HIMS changing name to THEMS
Something tells me to buy more $UVXY.
$GOOGL still gonna shit the bed and drag it down as usual.
"I give up on DD, scanning news etc. No matter what happens, bad goes down .5 percent, good, goes up 5 times as much, I am just going to get 0,1,or 2 $DTG calls from now until 2094"
almost all my sells in the past 2 weeks. I almost sold my $MSFT calls thi morning too...but instead i tried to learn and buy another one. Then i regretted only buying one.
Bought $270 $CRCL calls Friday. Sold them at market open today when $CRCL was at $245 ü•≤
"Some advice: don‚Äôt buy same day exp options after 10:00 am. Any bought at open should be closed before 12 or have a very good risk mitigation strategy ready. Buy next day exp if you really want to try a short trade. Otherwise, buy 45 days out. TIME IS YOUR FRIEND. . I only buy $LPTX (1 year out or more) options because the chance you‚Äôre up at some point is the highest and if things go wrong right away you have plenty of time to make it up."
"Sound like someone is selling his shares.... by the way, is the rumor about $TRUMP and $BTC will be used as gold certificate for upto the half of the gold in Fort Knox?. The coin holders can cash in their crypto for physical gold. The crypto will be deposit into 'strategic' US crypto reserve."
Rolling $NVDA gains into $GOOGL
Why everyone going deep into $GOOGL lately?
wtf. I did the same today. sold my $NVDA after a long hold and ported it into $GOOGL.
. All the regards buying $GOOGL right now
"Highly regarded to get out of $NVDA before the 25 June catalyst. No way $GOOGL will match the $NVDA upside.. For the record and future reference:. $NVDA @ 145.81 rn. $GOOGL @ 167.55 rn. Let's review in a month, or two, or ten."
Should have rolled it into $AMD.
Anyone else grabbing a seat before $HOOD annual meeting?
"$PLTR, GRRR and $BBAI."
I‚Äôm sorry $UNH bag holders
"options arent the move with $UNH, its a shares play."
"Bruh you‚Äôre only down 13%, chill this ain‚Äôt even a real WSB loss until you‚Äôre questioning your life choices at -80%. You still got time before 8/1, $UNH just needs to pump a bit and you‚Äôre golden. Don‚Äôt paper hand it yet, just breathe and maybe touch some grass."
I‚Äôm holding and everyone else should be too $UNH will have a moon candle this week
"I took a position around $295, when I saw $UNH go up to $315 I sold my shares, took a small profit and haven't messed with $UNH since. . Glad I did, $UNH has lost it's meme status for now, so I'm leaving it alone until the hype builds back up."
"My $2.7k call expiring 6/27 is evaporated lol... I got cod timing and $UNH is at 297 a share, FML. Goodbye to all that money"
the next $PLTR
"Well if its not options, then hats off to you. I lost about 1k last year gambling with $ASTS options. Literally last summer when the boom happened."
. 900 $ASTS shares at a $14 average. I was trying to squeeze premium because of $ASTS high volatility and it blew up recently. It‚Äôs covered calls but it still kinda sucks in hindsight. 
Man I knew my $XOM calls expired too soon. I should‚Äôve rolled them. Hahaha
Nitrogen stocks like $CFBK and $UAN üöÄ - the world needs nitrogen to eat üåΩ
Just change the name to The Strait Of AMERICA on $GOOGL Earth and tell Iran to suck it.

"well boyz i was always ballz deep in $RIG, problem is in not sure if that was the right companyüòÖ"
$CLBR üî´ 77 is my lucky number
Just an FYI 2 Wall Street lawyers put out some news yesterday looking to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù $CLBR to make sure it was providing proper valuation to its stockholders. Tbh seems like smoke (probably because the lawyers have a bone to pick with DTJ or the gun situation). That said I‚Äôm in 35 shares and I‚Äôm watching it slide to get in on 35 more before mergerü§°
"My first mistake was buying the $GOOGL dip, my second mistake was buying more, my next mistake will be buying it again"

Sir another plane has hit $HIMS
"value investing is such a fucking idiot meme idea when $CRCL can pump 20% per day with no business while $UNH dumps 2% per day making more profit than $CRCL ever will, increasing that profit every quarter, and paying a dividend. fucking clown market my bags are SO FUCKING HEAVY"

"Someone in r/thetagang prob gonna crosspost this ""ha some retard in WSB bought my calls!!"" but hey, I'm in for $3K worth of $175C i bought BEFORE power hour thinking it wouldn't just... keep... dropping smh but it did.

I‚Äôm gonna yolo on $GOOGL tomorrow. Supporting you bro

"I had 100% port in $GOOGL with 6 figures, sold for a loss on Friday close, got back in at at 181. It will open lower"

I own 50 shares of $GOOGL and I am tempted to buy puts just because of that dude...
$GOOGL bruh?
"Good god. Im a $GOOGL bull, but god damn good sir."
F*ck it bro you‚Äôve inspired me to buy $GOOGL calls tomorrow morning too ‚úäüèª
"GET OUT NOW.. Yes, TACO and all that, but not before massive pain has been inflicted. This will *in all likelihood* take more than a week to resolve, and in fact, the odds are high that things will greatly escalate from here.. The market will bleed *heavy* this week and there is no way that $GOOGL will close ATM in five fucking days. Get out get out get out. And maybe buy some oil."
$GOOGL never moves when you want it to move. Cut your loses tomorrow.
"Why the fuck would you throw it into $GOOGL instead of something that will literally print money, $LMT $XOM GUSH etc. This isn't a YOLO this is the Joker burning a pile of money."
At least this is a YOLO compared to that weakass shit from that 1000 $OXY shares guy.
" If $GOOGL doesn‚Äôt bounce hard, you‚Äôre basically donating to Robinhood."
Unless $GOOGL announces that they quantumed their way to uranus you're cooked
Dude why would you buy garbage like $GOOGL. This is one of the worst stocks to trade.
Sell it first thing Monday $GOOGL going down
I lost 30k on $GOOGL 180 call 6/20. Hope it makes you feel better
"What has to happen in $GOOGL by 6/27 to make your calls print I wonder. Are there any catalysts aside the ongoing antitrust case against $GOOGL, which 90% is going to be ruled out not to Google's benefit?"

$GOOGL said not this week.
$GOOGL YOU
I own $GOOGL too . The Europe mess is not helping and seems like it‚Äôs gonna cling to current levels until further notice . You may get lucky in it tho it‚Äôs gonna be close. . $GOOGL has not gained any steal even tho it‚Äôs a steller company . That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like options gambles cause I would‚Äôve went with what you went with for sure and I would‚Äôve been dead wrong
Robotaxi will kill $GOOGL
Something $GOOGL is about to happen over the next few days. Bigly.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Honestly full porting $GOOGL sounds like the move.  Might join you after a good Coinbase day

Another $GOOGL yolo $180 Aug 15th
Yolo‚Äôd shares and diamond handed. Sold. Will rebuy when $TSLA $300. See my previous YOLO post for proof when I YOLO‚Äôd. . 
$TSLA 7.9k gain shares
Bro really said ‚Äúhold the line‚Äù and meant it üíéüôå. That dip in Feb had me sweating for you but damn you came back swinging. $TSLA to the moon when it hits $300 again üöÄ.
"Will go up a gazillion percent, because of the unlimited potential of having FSD unsupervised 'next year' for over a decade and AI videos of humanoid robots that don't have a business model, with which you can infinitely lure gullible people into buying the stock.. Calls on $TSLA it is!"
$TSLA will keep going up despite everything indicating the opposite should be happening. Nothing new to see here.
"Seems everyone misses it, Melon has been talking about $AL driving the cars, not AI. He has hired a large number of people named $AL to ride in all the cars and drive them remotely."
$TSLA about to moon on a deep red market tomorrow because everyone will think sales will shatter records as oil prices double.
"I've flipped $TSLA for years, nothing crazy, pretty modest chunks, but always done well. 10% - 40% flips every time. I thought there would be a pop with the robotaxi release. Didn't do as well as I thought on it. I'm done tinkering with $TSLA for the foreseable future. Just a land mine waiting to go off IMO."
Pretty sure $TSLA will shoot higher on the news.
"A waymo costs $200K‚Äì$600K per car, while a robotaxi costs $30K. Since you could own a robotaxi and earn money while not using it, you would be responsible for maintaining it. Tesla would receive the data and machine learning insights from it.. Your robotaxi could be used to pick up food and groceries, and I‚Äôd rather have my groceries dropped off by a robotaxi than a human.. Tesla just has a better business model than $GOOGL and all the other self-driving car companies.. Having a human in the passenger seat is more about protecting the car from idiots.. I own Tesla."
I went all in on $UVXY on Friday. I prepped for this üòÇ
hmm guess my $RTX going to print on Mon
I bought puts to hedge against my $ASTS shares. This seems like a win/win for me.
$NVDA will rally 10% and Palantir 50% on Monday open
Somehow‚Ä¶. $TSLA calls still print Monday
"In no particular order:. - Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.. - Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  $TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.. - $TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means $TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than $TSLA.. - Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  $TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.. - I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.. - Elon is still popping off about one of Mango‚Äôs closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.. - $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.. - Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like $TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.. "
$60K on $TSLA Puts:  Why $TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.
The only flaw in your logic is that you're being logical.  I've been burned betting against $TSLA when I expected things like a terrible revenue/earnings report to actually be considered a negative.  Everything bad seems to be good.
OP how did it feel this morning seeing $TSLA not tank with the market despite all the war headlines?
I love seeing the $TSLA shorts get crushed day after day .
No update bro?   I enjoy watching $TSLA and $BTC doubters be wrong for years and years.  Yet still confidently proclaim that the whole market has been wrong all this time and the valuations are crazy.
It's been over half a decade and people are still torching their money on $TSLA puts.
lol clowns been losing money on $TSLA puts since $TSLA went public
I've been in $TSLA stock since the $10 days (2019) and have seen like a million of these posts.. Yet they keep burning their hard-earned money because Elon bad man ü§£
"$TSLA gonna be selling weaponized versions of Optimus to the US government.  Being deployed by weaponized cybertrucks.. Replace ""weaponized"" with ""expensive"".. Way undervalued right now."
Tesla just got some of the best news it could of possibly received. The senate slashed the provision in the BBB that cut ITC from $BESS.
"üòÇ brother, i saw a bunch of people lose money by $TSLA put since 2019"
You forgot that high oil prices is good for $TSLA
Every bear has had their war with $TSLA. . Anytime you get a big drop you have to take profits fast. It will probably tank some this week so sell a bunch of those and buy another set a couple months out if it shoots back up. It‚Äôs an exhausting game but can pay big.  It‚Äôs the same with $CVNA.  . If this market ever goes into a recession / 2022 style downturn these stocks will get smoked but no signs of that yet. . Some big money keeping it propped up. GL!
"As much as I agree with you, that would all make way too much sense. $TSLA just isn't a rational stock these days, and I've been burned betting against it before. I mean, just this year the Q1 earnings were awful, but the stock rallied. I've been avoiding $TSLA like the plague for that reason. Too unpredictable, and none of it seems tied to fundamentals at all."
"I was considering paper handing my $335C tomorrow. That‚Äôs for the boost of confidence. $TSLA $400 EOW. . The fact people confidently proclaim $TSLA is going down long term is insane. The cult following and institutional investment might be delusional, but it‚Äôs real. . Source: I tried to short $CVNA a year ago and almost went bankrupt."
"I would NOT get puts until the end of whatever rise will happen beginning of this week from the Iran strike. I wouldn't trust $TSLA to go down til the market's going down, but then I agree with puts on it."
"And it's gone!. Looking at OP comment history, he loves trash talking about $TSLA and Elon and now his money is all gone."
OP is the reason $TSLA is up today lmao.
WSB finally üåàüåàüêª on $TSLA . $TSLA Stonk go tits up now
$TSLA to $400. Calls it is.
You forgot that the market is forward looking. It's probably calculating what's happening in 2028 when RoboMusk takes $TSLA to the moon literally.
Godspeed ... $TSLA is going to pump to 350
Always inverse wsb. For that reason $TSLA is gonna moon
$TSLA market cap is higher than any other auto maker; it must be as high as the combined market cap of all other auto makers
I hope the person who wrote your puts uses the $60K to buy themselves a $TSLA. What a dumbass.
I lost 250K on $TSLA puts in Spring of 2017. It‚Äôs insane.
$TSLA will be down because everything but oil will be down.
"The threat of Iran war already caused $TSLA to pamp for some reason, maybe govt contracts or rising oil prices. If the war things cools off then maybe there's a sell off in the run up to earnings."
"RoboTaxi was just released in Austin, $TX. Will this help?"
"The Robotaxi thing seems like a very dangerous launch. Listening to Wallstreet Breakfast podcast, analysts in the know were talking about how the latest self-driving tests are still revealing serious flaws in the systems, like being unable to recognize things like one-way signs and school buses' extendable ""stop"" signs. One account even said it blew past a school bus and hit several child-sized dummies without stopping.. Not sure if there's any way to predict when the first deadly malfunction will occur‚Äîat least not with enough accuracy to make high-confidence buys of puts or put debit spreads‚Äîbut I definitely wouldn't feel safe going long on $TSLA for a while."
