I sold my house and dumped everything in to $BTC at $25K-$30K last cycle.  Woulda gone in at 16k but escrow took too long.  I shoulda got a loan in hindsight.. Still holding 7 $BTC and sold a few to get my original investment out and diversify a little.. I rent an apartment for $1050 a month.

"As someone who has not worked in 10 years due to some extremely lucky call options which I parlayed into passive income generating sources, I am starting to get real worried.. I live in San Diego but I'm originally from a smaller town in California.. I know 5 people who just got laid off from $300K+ jobs in $SF and LA, they were in tech so it's not that surprising, but it all happened quite concurrently.. What's more worrying though, is that about 1/3rd of my high school and college friends who did NOT end up moving to a major city have been laid off. Many of them are in law, accounting, or working corporate jobs in second tier US cities... and none of them can find jobs. They are between 30-40, and some of them have multiple young children.. The stock market keeps rocketing upwards... but this feels like a desperate, dying breath of people trying to YOLO their savings into money that can help them survive short term, rather than a healthy society and economy growing massively.. I get that we're in the ""AI boom"", but the AI boom is the first ""boom"" that is literally erasing white collar jobs en masse. My friend told me that his department was shrunk from 30 to 5 people, and he expects that the department will require only 1 person in the next couple of years. There are AI companies who build custom software for companies to help them reduce employees. Companies just hand over all their data and they are given back AI programs perfectly tailored to their needs.... Yet, everyday, a giant green dildo. Global tariffs? Green dildo. Nuclear war with Iran? Green dildo. Massive lay offs? Green dildo.. I know it's funny, especially if you're in the investor class and don't have to work... but something is beginning to feel seriously wrong. Does anyone have answers? This is the first time in my life that I have SEEN with my own eyes massive lay offs in my own social circles, who are all people with good college degrees, from good families, making at least $150K, but mostly $200K+.. Where do we go from here? More green dildos? Green dildos until the end of time? How many green dildos can society bear on it's unemployed back until its knees give out? I would appreciate some clarity."
"AI is a fad and a misnomer - one I‚Äôm leveraging to make money - but still a fad. ¬†I will be pulling the trigger on dumping my stonks the second it bobbles.. ¬†. I don‚Äôt believe the jobs are gone permanently. Just gone until the executives figure out the tech companies are selling more snake oil (metaverse, $DDD TV‚Äôs, etc).. What all of the tech companies and executives want you to ignore is that AI isn‚Äôt actually AI. ¬†It‚Äôs LLM - Large Language Model. ¬†It‚Äôs just a fancy algorithm, that you feed information into and it spits out a human like response based on the parameters that it was fed. And still sometimes fucks up spectacularly (‚ÄúI am Mechahitler‚Äù - Grok AI, now shut down).. But still, they will improve the software and it will get better. ¬†But until we reach the singularity (Where true AI becomes aware and capable of learning), most jobs will be safe. ¬†Some jobs, which are highly rules based and standardized, will likely be reduced or eliminated (call centers, etc). ¬†. In other fields, it‚Äôs functionally useless. ¬†For instance, an AI may be capable of writing a will, but can it handle a criminal defense or tort case? ¬†. Or in engineering. ¬†It‚Äôs not going to be out there resolving the issues when we find old pipe under the ground while building. ¬†It can‚Äôt give instructions to the pipefitters and electricians. ¬†Maybe it can help me with drawings and some calcs, but not much else.. In fact - several companies have already announced that they are hiring back a large number of the people they let go.. Here‚Äôs Klarna for one example: ¬†. Then, there‚Äôs all this talk of ‚ÄúAgentic AI‚Äù that will schedule my vacation and wipe my butt when I poop. ¬†Again, if it happens, it will be acting on explicit directions from you. ¬†No actual decision making."
"honestly, in the case of tech... I see these companies *finally* ridding themselves of insanely inflated dev contracts. There are so many young coders, and a lot of them are decent. It's *super* hard to find a good job in the industry right now. . With AI, all else remaining equal, I expect productivity to stagnate as payroll falls. I'm not saying it can replace a coder yet, but it can make someone with 2-years of job experience work as if they had 4. More interesting to me is the fact that I don't need to prioritize the quantitative skills *as much* during the hiring process, which generally means I can hire someone with better soft/qualitative skills and not have to worry as much. AI can be an amazing supplement to the IQ part of your team, but it'll never do anything for the $EQ."
Apparently they were running some shady algo stuff. $FSS (Financial Supervisory Service) hit them with a $300M fine. Rumors say it might go up to $600M if the appeal fails.

Hell yeah.. Replacing my $LUNR with these guys lol.
"I bought my first and only PC on Newegg back in 2013 for $1200.  Had a i7-3770k, a $GTX 680, and a gigabyte motherboard.  It‚Äôs still trucking along to this day.  I would like to see GameStop buy Newegg."
"Today I did the financial equivalent of freebasing AI hype and slapping the buy button like it wronged my ancestors. 500 contracts. $CRWV 150C. Expiring next Friday. Because nothing says ‚Äúemotional stability‚Äù like lighting $27K on fire for a company that sounds like a crypto rug pull dressed in a Patagonia vest.. Do I have a plan? Sort of. The plan is Wall Street suddenly remembers CoreWeave is the unofficial dealer for every AI junkie in Silicon Valley. The plan is that Nvidia wakes up feeling flirty and drags the entire sector with it. The plan is that something literally anything sends this stock full anime power up mode and rips it $20+ by next Friday. That‚Äôs the plan. Is it good? Absolutely not. But it‚Äôs mine.. My thesis? It‚Äôs AI. It‚Äôs hot. It‚Äôs underloved. It‚Äôs due. If $NVDA can hit $1400 off vibes and a Midjourney slideshow, then CoreWeave can absolutely rip on pure speculation and caffeine.. If it hits? I walk into a SoftBank yacht party like I belong there and soft launch my fund: Delusional Vibe Capital.. If it doesn‚Äôt? I explain to my mom why her retirement is now tied up in something that sounds like a League of Legends champion.. My entire investment strategy is basically ‚Äútrust the vibes, ignore the Greeks.‚Äù. I‚Äôm not just long on $CRWV. I‚Äôm long on delusion.. Next Friday either I‚Äôm printing money like Jerome Powell on espresso‚Ä¶ or I‚Äôm crying into a bowl of expired ramen, Googling ‚Äúhow to sell feet pics anonymously.‚Äù. Let‚Äôs fucking weave."
"YOLO‚Äôd 500 $CRWV 150 Calls for Next Friday! No Hedge, No Braincells, Just AI-Induced Delusion"
If $NVDA can hit off vibes? Listen to yourself.
That‚Äôs actually smart. But it usually goes sideways for a while before epically skyrocketing. So ill have some losses next weeks please. Guess ill buy on Monday when it‚Äôll be over 140$ already and then stick to 135$ for the whole week. Probably sell it for a loss on Friday at 128$ after giving up all hope just to see it go up to 160$+ at markets closing. Classic $CRWV trading for me. Can‚Äôt wait for it.
If $NVDA can hit off vibes.
"I think the better opportunity in AI would've been $MRVL. Not trying to ruin your vibes but you WAY overpaid for an options contract with so little time remaining and that far out of the money. To make matters worse, you did it 500 times lol"

Why the fk is $GOOGL lower than other big tech
$AMZN thinks I want women's clothing now because I always click on items where the model's feet is visible so I can zoom in. $AMZN just doesn't understand the average consumer. Puts.
"$NVDA goes sub $100. ""The AI bubble has popped, $NVDA is absolutely cooked."". $NVDA hits all-time highs. ""Should I buy Nvidia?"""
Fun fact: If you bought $AAPL a year ago on this day....you would be negative.

I loved $GOOGL like a brother in law
"Craziest thing is that the economy has been a zombie for 2+ years now but none of this matters to the markets. Reality is that everyone‚Äôs money just depends on the performance and valuation of a few tech stocks as households are at record levels of invested capital and 40%+ of the S&P is in 10 stocks. Translation, most of the Russel 2000 can disappear tomorrow but if $NVDA is up by a couple percentage points then markets will probably not even notice. We are getting tariffs announcements on major allies and the market could not give 2 shits, it just continues marching towards ATH as $NVDA makes its way to 5T market cap. Virtually worth more than most countries at this point."

"What do you think could actually bring $TSLA down¬†. It's not: bad earnings, car accidents, high positions in the company quitting, Elon calling the president a pedophile, starting a new party. Whats left out there that could push it down below 250$"
Bought $NVDA in 2022 because I liked gaming. 870% gain for $168K later
I bought $NVDA in 2000 because a friend told me it was a hot ticket. He was right. I sold my stake later that same year at a tidy profit to pay off what remained of my student loans. Had I held it I'd probably be able to buy myself a seat on the Board of Trustees these days.
"I bought $IBM in 2022 because I like quantum, wish me luck"
"I bought at the same time too, except it wasn‚Äôt because ‚ÄúI liked gaming‚Äù it was because $NVDA was still $NVDA and everyone knew it in 2022, and had fallen by 60%."
I bought 3 $AMD shares at 15$ and sold them a year or two later for 100$ each because i was broke.
I was making some decent money selling $NVDA puts in 2022. Eventually my luck ran out and the stock fell below my strike price and I was forced to buy the shares. Said fuck it and just kept them. Worked out pretty well for me: 
"Diamond hands, bro. $NVDA aint going nowhere. You know how many people sold $AAPL 20 years ago who‚Äôd be sitting on a Caribbean island right now if they hadn‚Äôt?"
I just did this lookup yesterday actually. You bought when chatgpt was shown off. The writing was on the walls in big bold letters. BUY $NVDA
I still kick myself for not grabbing this and $AMD back in 2018 when I first stumbled into RH $AMD was $20 and lower at the time and I was out here failing to be a option trader üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ good shit
"I blew up my account in 2019 because I had a lot of credit card debt needing to be paid. I had $NVDA, $AMD, Corsair, Tesla, and Meta all because I liked gaming and EVs. Sold all of it. Every last dollar"
Now you can afford the new $RTX
"I brought $NVDA in 2022 thinking the gpu inventory due to bitcoin slump was going to be a temporary thing, didn‚Äôt know all that much about ai chips back then, sold all of my positions  after 2nd q earning with about 3x ish gain. Should‚Äôve had a little bit more patience"
I bought in 2021 because that was my graphics card brand. Same with $IBM. I just thought I use all these companies in my computers why wouldn‚Äôt I start with stocks I believe in. My profit isn‚Äôt as high as yours but I‚Äôm still insanely happy with where it‚Äôs gotten my portfolio.
I did the same thing auth $AMD...
I did the same. However I thought $NVDA already had their AI moment back in 2022-2023 so I bought the Advanced Money Destroyer (aka AMD)
"Now, imagine if you bought leveraged $NVDA shares.. I'm in NVDL."
I bought $NVDA in 2020 and it was already the number 1 Ai play
"Back in '23 i was looking around on a finance website, checking out a few stocks and their forecasts. $NVDA got my attention. It said that the minimal forecastes price is above the current price. That's obviously free money right? So that's how I made my first investments. Got me into investing."
"$NVDA gains thread?  Here's mine:. Acquired|Term|$ Total Gain/Loss|% Total Gain/Loss|Current Value|Quantity|Average Cost Basis|Cost Basis Total. :--|:--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:. Jan-11-2018|Long|+$315,365.63|+2802.16%|$326,620.00|2,000|$5.63|$11,254"
. Good to see another early nvda investor. I bought it originally because I built a PC with a $GTX 1080ti back in 2017 and I was impressed with how it performed. Then in 2018 I read about Nvidia's involvement with autonomous driving and decided to invest more.
I'll take your share volume and my cost basis. Added $NVDA because I wanted to spread exposure beyond $AMD and $MU (lol).. 
That right there is the money shot. In about 5 years that position will be worth $1.5MM and OP is gonna cash out retiring early....or he goes full regard and sells everything to buy into $NVDA calls.
I sold my nvda gain at 100% and bought $GOOGL. Fml
"Almost same. Except I bought 500 shares of $AMD because I liked gaming. And as a poor college student, $AMD products were all I could afford. When I started investing, $AMD at $6 was all I could afford. Not too mad about it though"
I chose Corsair and Tattooed Chef over $NVDA at this time and now I‚Äôm sticking to index funds lol
"I've been a gamer all my life and built every rig i owned, I never thought about investing in $NVDA because I'm blind and oblivious."
Well I bought TDFX instead of $NVDA circa 2000 because TDFX had better technology!
Never sale!!! $NVDA still got 20 years in tanks left
"As a person who‚Äôs not at all savvy when it comes to stocks, my $NVDA makes me the happiest! A friend told me to buy so I got 100 shares only - wish I had gotten more... "
I did the same with $AMD and I'm up almost 2% now!
I had the same thesis except I bought $AMD @ 75 because Intel CPUs were clearly shit. If only I thought about the GPUs‚Ä¶

"I've seen this happen before and I have been able to take advantage of it once. Did a limit order on $AMD to buy the smaller number then immediately set a sell order for the bigger number and scalped $1K in 2 seconds..

"I tried posting about this before but hoping the mods allow now that it‚Äôs well above $500 million MC. While my typical day to day market activity includes selling spreads, I have accumulated the majority of my current gains by swing/longer term investing. As you can see, I have been early many times, but never wrong. I watched my $ASTS position drop 80%+ and had to wait for the market to realize what I already knew. Similar patterns happened with most of my stocks.. I‚Äôm not going to bother with a long DD other than to say this has been one of the most hated stocks on the market and left for dead. They‚Äôre narrowing their losses, getting closer to breakeven/profitability, and not remotely close to the bankruptcy risk the current market cap is reflecting. Rate cuts are upon us (likely by September/October) and real estate stocks in general will have their own sentiment run. OPEN is one of the most volatile of the bunch.. This will be one of the easiest 2-3X you can have this year but most of you regards still won‚Äôt follow me. Long 40k shares"

$RKT is a better company.. they have their own real estate ecosystem. One of its kind.. once the interest rates comes down and people start refinancing watch for $RKT.

"Hi,. i'll keep it short and sweet. $CRM is my bet for upcoming tech earnings season. For the below reasons. \- company has been overspending on M&A which was a big mistake for a growth company that needs to have sustainable organic growth first. Now the company has finally shifted to focus on profitability and stopped its spending spree. \- They have acquired some valuable businesses/segments however the synergies are inclear. I am betting that they will give more clarity upcoming earnings call. \- Stock has flatlined since April 2nd Tariff Board Debacle, however $MSFT, $ORCL, $NOW and $SNOW have recovered nicely. $CRM looks like the $GOOGL / black sheep of the bunch but this all might turn soon.. \- Word on the street is AGENTFORCE, this is their racehorse that is supposed to make up for all the legacy software that they have been selling in the past. I believe this is a gamechanger for $CRM because of the populair demand. They have finally found their place in the a.i. revolution. . Downsides. \- Company has been spending like crazy and fumble the bag on earnings calls. They could not reassure analysts that they know they will make a profit in the future from all these acquistions. \- I am getting $GOOGL vibes from this company  meaning that we all know it has potential but it doesn't get the same love from its peers. .

"its not $GOOGL vibe, $CRM has adobe vibe"
"For some reason I actually believe that they'll do well in the short-run as the AI hype train moves on. . They have a strong in with the large group of US companies who do not know what they are doing when it comes to tech but wants to feel modern at a ""decent price"". They'll pump renewals and upgrades using the AI hype and then upsell again. . But it'll all come falling down when ROI never materializes and the squeeze comes for the minnows and regional midmarket. . (But their products are slop and I'd never recommend/use/encourage anyone to use them.  Sad to see Slack's slow descent into $CRM shit)"

" **TLDR:** The bull run in U.S. critical minerals has officially started, fueled by DoD billions and the freshly signed Big Beautiful Bill.. **Pentagon MP-DoD Deal**. The Defense Department and $MP Materials agreed to a multiyear package intended to anchor a fully U.S. rare earth magnet supply chain. The deal combines direct Pentagon funding with private credit, guarantees the plant‚Äôs offtake for a decade and makes DoD the company‚Äôs largest shareholder.. **Announcement Summary:**. * **$400 million** in DoD convertible-preferred equity (plus warrants). * **$150 million** DoD loan to add heavy-rare-earth separation at Mountain Pass. * **$1 billion** construction credit line from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs. * New ‚Äú10X‚Äù magnet facility lifts MP‚Äôs U.S. capacity to **‚âà10,000 t/yr** (commissioning 2028). * **Ten-year price floor** of **$110 kg NdPr** and DoD agreement to buy **100 % of output**. * DoD stake can reach **‚âà15 %** of $MP on a fully converted basis. The critical minerals sector rallied sharply as markets reacted to two major policy events: the Pentagon‚Äôs multibillion dollar magnet-plant deal with $MP Materials and President Trump‚Äôs proposal of a 50% tariff on imported copper. Investors rotated into names that stand to benefit from U.S. efforts to secure domestic supply chains and diversify away from Chinese sources.. **Stocks in today‚Äôs move(Sympathy Rise):**. * **MP Materials ($MP): +53.78% intraday**. * **The Metals Company ($TMC): +8.61% intraday** ‚Äì Possibly driven by (1) speculative next deal potential after CEO Gerard Barron‚Äôs tweet two days ago highlighting the ‚ÄúOne Big Beautiful Bill‚Äù with over $7 billion in grants and tax incentives for mineral processing (very speculative) , and (2) and possibly due to Trump‚Äôs tweet yesterday proposing a 50% copper tariff, which makes high grade domestic sources more valuable. TMC‚Äôs polymetallic nodules grade 1.1‚Äì1.5% copper‚Äîwell above the \~0.7% average of many land mines‚Äîin a pure, loose seafloor form requiring no blasting or waste rock handling, plus \~1.3‚Äì1.4% nickel, \~0.2% cobalt, and high manganese. (very speculative).. * **Freeport-McMoRan ($FCX): +22% intraday** ‚Äì largest U.S. copper miner and a major gold producer; tariff tailwind improves net-backs on Morenci, Bagdad and Miami output while management argues it could speed federal approvals for the Lone Star and Resolution projects (very speculative).. * **Southern Copper ($SCCO): +2.1% intraday** ‚Äì low-cost producer with \~70 bn lb of proven reserves; tariff narrative lifts its U.S. mines (Bisbee, Mission) and adds option value to undeveloped Arizona/San Gabriel assets despite Peru exposure (very speculative).. * **Energy Fuels ($UUUU): +15.6% intraday** ‚Äì only U.S. company already producing mixed rare-earth carbonate at commercial scale from monazite feed; investors betting DoD/DOE grants could finance Phase-2 separation at White Mesa, complementing its uranium-vanadium stream (very speculative).. * **Rio Tinto ($RIO): +2.7% intraday** ‚Äì diversified major; tariff benefits its 55% stake in the Resolution JV (Arizona) and lifts sentiment around the Oyu Tolgoi copper expansion (very speculative).. * **BHP Group ($BHP): +3.9% intraday** ‚Äì follows Rio; owns Escondida (world‚Äôs largest copper mine) and Nickel West, both leveraged to EV demand. U.S. tariff backdrop could enhance pricing power if Oak Dam and Jansen downstream options advance (very speculative).. The day‚Äôs moves underscore a broader strategic shift: **Washington is racing to reclaim supremacy across the critical mineral supply chain, and history suggests that when the United States commits to an industrial contest it aims for first place.**.

"I'll start by saying, I've been following this company for quite some time. I wrote this DD last night and unfortunately did not get to posting it in time. (kms). You don't have to believe me it is okay. **My thesis and everything I am about to say still remains true.** . Up 109.56% in the last year, $MP Materials ($MP), is a fantastic investment. At a price per share of $30.03, this is an absolute steal. Let‚Äôs get into why I believe so. **Edit: (Now at a price of $45.23)**. **Overview -** The company operates in the Rare Earth Element (REE) mining industry. A key part of this thesis is that they are UNITED STATES based. As a matter of fact, they are the only U.S. producer and supplier of REE‚Äôs. They fully own and operate Mountain Pass, which is a rare earth mine in San Bernardino, California. This mine has been around for quite some time, first being used in 1952. Throughout the 60‚Äôs and 80‚Äôs, Mountain Pass was the world‚Äôs dominant $REE supplier, producing over 70% of global REE‚Äôs at its peak. The most abundant ore in the mine is called Bastnasite, which is one of the three primary earth minerals. This ore contains 6%-8% of Total Rare Earth Oxide (TREO) which is considered exceptionally high by global standards. Most deposits contain 1%-4% $TREO. $TREO is a standard measurement used in the $REE mining industry to express $REE content in ore.. **Production -** Now listen up. In April of 2022, the company announced plans to build a 250,000 sqft plant in Fort Worth, Texas which it calls ‚ÄúThe Independence Facility‚Äù. This plant is the first fully integrated rare earth metal, alloy, and magnet manufacturing plant in the United States. The building has since been completed. In early 2025, the facility began commercial production of NdPr metal, and trial production of automotive-grade sintered neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets. This marks a significant achievement for the company, and for the U.S. supply chain as a whole. The trial production of NdFeB magnets is set to switch to commercial production towards the end of 2025. This facility will have the ability to produce magnet supply for 500,000 EV‚Äôs every year, and they are already partnered with $GM for this. $MP Materials magnets will be in the HUMMER EV, Cadillac LYRIQ, Chevrolet Silverado EV, and more than a dozen other models. **The news of their magnets going into commercial production will be the next large catalyst for the stock.** . **What is NdPr?** Neodymium-Praseodymium is a rare earth alloy that is critical in the production of high-powered magnets which are NdFeB magnets. Neodymium provides magnetic strength while Praseodymium provides corrosion and heat resistance.. **Why are NdFeB magnets important?** They are a critical part of the modern world and supply chain. Demand in recent years has been skyrocketing as the continued shift towards clean energy continues. There are endless applications for these magnets, some of which include: Use in electric vehicle motors, wind turbines, smartphones, laptops, missile guidance systems, drones, radars, fighter jets, MRI machines, and more. In a report by the S&P Global Market Intelligence, the use of NdFeB magnets in electric vehicles is expected to be the biggest driver of demand, which is predicted to increase from 7.1% of all $REE demand now, to 23.8% by 2040. The main component of these magnets is Iron at about 65%-70%, while NdPr makes up 28%-32%.. **Understanding the Supply Chain -** Now that we have established the basics, the main thesis lies in the global supply chain. For decades, China has dominated both $REE production and supply. This means they have nearly full control over NdPr, and therefore, they also control production of the highly demanded NdFeB magnets. Mining these REE‚Äôs is not as simple as taking it out of the ground. The mined ore needs to be processed which means it gets sent to China because they dominate the refinement process too‚Ä¶ In the words of Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping, ‚ÄúThe Middle East has oil. China has rare earths.‚Äù However, in recent years, the U.S. and other countries like Australia, have opened their eyes and realized they need their own domestic production. In 2024, the United States produced 45,000 tonnes of REO‚Äôs (Rare Earth Oxides). That represents 6.9% of the world‚Äôs total production for the year. China on the other hand, produced 270,000 tonnes of ROE‚Äôs, representing 69% of world production. So not only does China produce the most significant amount of REO‚Äôs, but they also process and refine a whopping 90% of the world‚Äôs REE‚Äôs. Their ability to do so comes from decades of investment, focused on building a vertically integrated supply chain.. It is a matter of national defense that the U.S. gets NdFeB magnets. Since 2020, the DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic $REE supply chains. Their main focus being to create a ‚Äúmine-to-magnet‚Äù process. That is exactly what the company $MP Materials is focused on becoming. As mentioned, in the latter half of 2025, they are expecting to be commercially producing NdFeB magnets. They will be the ONLY United States company capable of mining REE‚Äôs and processing them into NdFeB magnets. That is not to say there are not other magnet producers in the U.S, just none quite like $MP Materials.. This business strategy is already paying off. NdPr oxide and metal revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was $24.32 million, compared to $8.33 million in the previous first quarter. That is a 192% increase. Their NdPr production rose 330% in the same period, with sales of NdPr increasing by 246%. **When looking at things like their income statement, nothing is going to wow you. This is not a company having record breaking years by any means.** That is why we must understand the bigger picture and the need for domestic $REE production. . **RECENT NEWS: July 10****^(th)****, 2025.** $MP Materials just secured $1 billion in funding from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to build its second U.S. magnet manufacturing plant, which is called the ‚Äú10x facility‚Äù because it is set to 10x their production. This facility is set to be completed in 2028. On top of this, the Department of Defense purchased $400 million worth of stock, making them the largest shareholder in the company at 15%. The DoD is also issuing a $150 million loan to support $MP Materials expansion of their heavy rare-earth separation at Mountain Pass.. This deal sent the price flying! I suspect it will come back down for a nice buying opportunity. However, I think anything under $100 with this stock is a great deal. In the coming years, I see this stock being a top performer in the market. . Position - . "
This is Only the Beginning ($MP) $MP Materials

"Look at the rare earths china export banned. Look at how little $MP makes of the banned ones. Those heavy ree's mostly come from ionic clays. This deal was a sweetheart deal, no doubt, and one that I am kicking myself for missing, but there are no fundumbmentals at play here aside from graft."
"I bought $MP in several ‚Äòdips‚Äô after it topped out at $55ISH 3-4 years ago. Held 3,000 shares at an average price of $30 for years, all the way through rock bottom $10-$11.  Diamond hands. Was so happy to sell it off at an average of $34-$35 over the last month for a decent profit.. Felt like a genius after it was falling back to $30 and downgraded this week.. Then of course today happens and I hate myself.. Am I an idiot?"
"Solid DD, I‚Äôm a bit biased as I work at $MP but the improvement and decision making in the past 3 years has been pretty incredible looking back on it and it‚Äôs only getting better with each month. I would absolutely agree it‚Äôs just the beginning!"
"There‚Äôs no heavy $REE at MP; never has been. They plan on importing it, the pentagon deal is more for the 10x magnet plant. Not saying it‚Äôs not a good investment it‚Äôs got a guaranteed buyer now. However there‚Äôs another player building a magnet plant in $TX that is mining Heavy $REE, don‚Äôt know how that‚Äôs going to work out now, but $MP will have to buy it from somewhere not China at some point."
"‚ÄúToday¬†*we*'*re doing copper*,‚Äù said¬†Trump. So I thought, ok maybe they're doing rare metals tomorrow, and bought some $MP calls. I am shocked that this play was rewarded so quickly and so bigly. "

". If the US imposed a 50% tariff on Brazilian goods and Brazil hit back with its own 50% tariff on US products as announced, these are a sample of American companies that could face real trouble:. Mondelez (MDLZ): Brazil is a huge snack market for Oreo and Lacta. Retaliatory tariffs could raise prices and shrink demand.. Caterpillar (CAT): Brazil is a big buyer of Caterpillar‚Äôs mining and farm machinery. Higher tariffs could slash equipment sales.. Chevron (CVX): Chevron‚Äôs oil production in Brazil could face new taxes or tougher rules, cutting into profits.. McDonald‚Äôs (MCD): Brazil is McDonald‚Äôs largest Latin American market through Arcos Dorados. Tariffs could raise food costs and hurt local sales.. Ford (F): Ford still sells cars and parts in Brazil. Tariffs both ways could push up costs and dampen demand.. General Motors (GM): $GM depends on Brazilian factories and buyers. Retaliation could disrupt parts supply and hurt local sales.. Coca-Cola (KO): Coke counts on Brazil for big sales and sugar supplies. Brazil is main Coca cola market in Latin America. Tariffs on both sides will affect margins and reduce demand.. Given the US tariffs announcement are based on shallow reasons to begin with (you didn‚Äôt treat well my friend Bolsa‚Ä¶), I suspect that that these announcements will be short lived."
"Sounds like a win for China and India to me. The B in BRICS is Brazil, correct? $CAT is the biggest loser with all these tariffs they are getting hit at both ends."
"Mondelez, Coca-Cola and McDonalds likely source and manufacture stuff locally in Brazil. I doubt $MCD is shipping buns and patties to Brazil."
"WHITENET represents the kind of resilient infrastructure today's volatile markets demand. While legacy giants like Chevron, McDonald's, and $GM face regulatory and tariff shocks in Brazil, decentralized networks like WHITENET operate borderlessly, immune to political retaliation and centralized risk. As traditional finance gets squeezed by geopolitics, WHITENET offers a foundation for global, permissionless trade and real-world asset tokenization without the overhead of jurisdictional friction."

"GL, but I would have put it into $CNC"
When it happened to $UNH I bought a lot of shares at 280 and made. But $UNH drop was due to justice department investigation into fraudulent activities with Medicare and Medicaid billing which investors hoped that the CEO two came out of retirement will resolve. $CNC crash happened last week after the earning announcements due to failing to give a forward guidance as a result of deep Medicaid and Medicare costs due to the   big beautiful bill that just passed. Investors are worried that United healthcare may also issue a weak guidance due to the deep future government reimbursement  after earnings announcement which could bring the stock to new low level‚Ä¶.

Watch out what happened to $CNC could  to United healthcare after the earning call.  It lost half of his value due to Obamacare cuts in the new center bill.  Also check out Molina healthcare They dropped big time as well. This sector is radioactive.
$UNH about to get more coverage than my insurance plan.

This is your chance to right that wrong and make a shit ton of money in the process.. **SKIP THIS PART IF RETARDED:**. Thanks to $NVDA and Co, computer chips are faster than ever. The problem? Electronic data transmission can't keep up. Because of thermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around 100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those $NVDA chips companies pay millions for, they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics (data transmission using light). Okay, so who is making this technology? A lot of companies (Broadcom, Mitsubishi, Foxconn, Lumentum, etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmission modules. This is where $POET Technologies comes in (here is their website, if you want to try to better understand what they do: [POET](. $POET is incredibly well-positioned for the inevitable photonics boom. Their partners include Foxconn, Mitsubishi, Celestial AI, Luxshare, Adtran, Mentech, and Lessengers. $POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their Optical Modules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI data centers, cloud computing, telecom, etc. Diagram for the mentally impaired:. Now, $POET is a pre-revenue company. However, the switch from electronic to photonic chip-level data transmission is happening *as we speak*. And so, the single most important statement of this entire DD: **POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR $CUBB AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXT MONTHS, WEEKS, OR DAYS.** The reason why this hasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait 6-9 months to test-run the technology before finalizing their orders -- standard practice in the industry ([Source]( In other words, the orders have ALREADY BEEN PLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfilling them: ""In fact, \[Rep. from $POET customer\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for the solution."" [(](. With such a small market cap, a skeptic might wonder how $POET would be able to defend their valuable position in the industry. First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology ([Source]( Additionally, their various partners/customers have incorporated POET's technology into a wide variety of transmission speeds: 400Gbps, 800Gbps, 1.6Tbps, and even 3.2Tbps. Right now, 1.6T and 3.2T are not needed in the vast majority of cases. However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the coming years, they'll still be buying optical modules with POET's tech inside. Because of this, I cannot reiterate enough how well-positioned $POET is to capitalize on the AI / data center boom.. **IF RETARDED, START READING HERE:**. Knowing that $POET will start making money hand-over-fist in the near future, the next step is to calculate how much they could actually make. Taken from their Q4 2024 earnings report:. ""Established a major wafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines in Penang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics Manufacturing Sdn. Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer and contractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial **1 million $POET optical engines annually**."" ([Source](. But that's not all. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even more production, expected to be ready in 1 to 2 quarters:. ""POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engine assemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and **addressing growing customer demand**."" ([Source](. Because the Globetronics facility is already up and running ([Source]( I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facility alone. Again, being conservative, I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 a pop. 1M units \* $250 / unit is $250M. Multiply that by a P/S ratio of 10, and you get a market cap of $2.5B -- representing a **5X** from the current market cap of $500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in any day. But let's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in the future. $MMM units \* $500 / unit (accounting for 1.6T, 3.2T being more expensive) \* 10 P/S ratio = $15B market cap -- **30X upside** from current share price.. The best part about this situation? Wall Street doesn't care enough about pre-revenue microcaps to understand POET's potential. Once institutions take the time to understand POET's position in a rapidly burgeoning industry, this thing will practically double overnight (And yes, I know that it's already up over 50% from the recent lows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt cap requirement).. If this stock gets ANY sort of public attention, the market will quickly re-price its valuation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news (fulfilled purchase orders, revenue, new products, etc), this has the potential to go on a crazy run. The only caveat is that I can't tell you when exactly this could happen. POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue -- I'd guess orders start getting announced before September. That doesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in a month, though.. The easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill -- I am almost certain that $POET will at least double by the end of the year. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares -- go for 1/16/26 or 1/15/27 10c. The options chain is stupidly bullish, and it could easily gamma squ\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTM calls.. My base case is $12/SHARE by EOY, and $30/SHARE by Q3 2026. My optimistic case is $30/SHARE by EOY, and $45-60/SHARE (3.75B to 5B mkt cap) by Q3 2026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the right time.. **TL;DR** \-- $POET, a $500M mkt cap photonics company, is on the cusp of generating significant revenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5X return, minimum. The market is largely unaware of this stock, and it will undergo a dramatic re-pricing in the coming weeks and months. Buy into the next multi-bagger BEFORE it happens.. **Position:**. EDIT: Initially forgot about this, but they've won a bunch of awards for their technology. Doesn't really mean much for share price, but it's evidence that this whole thing isn't vaporware. . **2025 Lightwave‚ÄØAward ‚Äì ‚ÄúOutstanding AI Hardware‚Äù** ([Source](. **2025 AI Breakthrough Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúAI Hardware Innovation Award‚Äù** ([Source](. **2024 Global Tech Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúBest in Artificial Intelligence‚Äù** ([Source](. **2024 Merit Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúAI Innovator of the Year‚Äù** ([Source](. **2024 AI Breakthrough Awards ‚Äì ‚ÄúBest Optical AI Solution‚Äù** ([Source]("

"Big expectations from the CEO, below is the newsletter sent to investors today ...hence the 18% jump? ..  . The latter half of 2025 looks VERY interesting...Thanks again to Steady Jerry for placing this on my radar üôè  . (NFA or a solicitation to buy or sell a stock)  . $POET Technologies Newsletter  . LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN & CEO  . Dear Friends,  . In Q2 of 2025, $POET executed on our decision to move our optical engine assembly and testing facilities out of China and into Malaysia. We opened the doors to an 8,000-square-foot space in Malaysia that holds state-of-the-art equipment and provides every tool necessary to produce 1 million $POET optical engines per year. Those engines will drive the next generation of hardware devices for the AI and data center markets.  . The manufacturing center in Penang asserts the company‚Äôs aggressive shift into commercialization. We can scale up to meet the demand from our customers who are seeking to rapidly improve AI and data center connectivity.   . Located inside of Globetronics‚Äô massive building, the $POET production floor features 25 units of equipment and a growing team of exceptional engineers. They work closely with our Asian headquarters in Singapore to bring scalable wafer-level innovation based on the $POET Optical Interposer‚Ñ¢ to reality. We also added NationGate, the largest electronics manufacturing services provider in Malaysia, as an additional assembler of our external light source products.  . Our publicly announced customers have already received samples of our optical engines and light sources, and are evaluating how they integrate with their own devices. As the second half of 2025 begins, we expect purchase orders to arrive as end-user customers qualify our partners‚Äô optical modules. With two qualified sub-contractors in place, we are in a good position to add additional manufacturing capacity to meet any further demand past the current level of 1 million units.  . You can see a video of our manufacturing facility in action here.  . Our products at the cutting-edge of the optoelectronics industry have received praise from our customers and industry observers. We just received our second consecutive AI Breakthrough Awards win, earning Best AI Hardware Innovation for $POET Teralight‚Ñ¢, our line of 1.6T ultra-high performance optical engines.  . In less than three months, $POET transformed our production resources into a full wafer-scale operation. Now, we are ready to launch the next stage of our journey. It will be the most exciting phase yet. We have just successfully concluded our Annual General and Special Meeting and are ready to pursue a fortuitous next 12 months."

"I felt this way about $POET back in January, now it‚Äôll be a pump n dump"
"This post is spot on, well researched. I concur with the bullish possibility. It could go up faster and further than this. The AI frenzy is unlike anything we have ever seen in terms of rapid investment of hundreds of billions, and $POET helps leverage these dollars with more energy-efficient connections. Energy efficiency and speed are the product of POET's devices, and they've done it in a cost-effective, scalable manner. This is a potential rocket for these reasons. Beyond data centers, there are further markets in fiber networks to homes and businesses, cellular networks, sensors and Lidar for vehicles; all can benefit from a tiny chip that converts electrical signals to photonics. These lower-cost markets could license the tech from $POET, a pure profit arrangement, while $POET concentrates on the high-margin data center markets. Potential rocket ship."

"Decent write-up, but this reads more like a hype piece than a sober DD. POET‚Äôs tech sounds legit *in theory*, and the photonics bottleneck is real ‚Äî nobody‚Äôs disputing that. The problem is the massive gap between ‚Äútesting phase‚Äù and ‚Äúrecurring revenue.‚Äù Pre-revenue companies are graveyards for investor capital *unless* there‚Äôs a proven ramp + real demand + execution.. Yes, the partnerships are interesting (Foxconn, Mitsubishi, etc.), but ""partnership"" ‚â† revenue. Hyperscalers test dozens of components and only scale up a handful. Until $POET shows actual POs being fulfilled at scale, all these projections are speculative.. Also, slapping a 10x P/S multiple on a pre-revenue microcap is optimistic at best and misleading at worst. Those valuations come *after* revenue is growing and margins are proven ‚Äî not before. Right now, this is still a bet on management, execution, and market timing.. TL;DR: Interesting company, and photonics is a real tailwind, but don‚Äôt confuse a good story with a good investment. Size accordingly and don‚Äôt mortgage the house on Reddit hopium."

"Waited to have a post about this stock as it has just come out of penny status and now has a 1b+ market cap as of yesterday.. If you‚Äôve been sleeping on $NAK at ~$2.10, ($2.20 in premarket), wake up.. Northern Dynasty is deep in settlement talks with the EPA to reverse the 2023 veto on the world-class Pebble copper-gold-moly project in Alaska, with a joint status report due July 17, 2025. CEO Ron Thiessen calls these negotiations ‚Äúthe fastest path forward‚Äù for withdrawing the veto and getting the Army Corps back to permitting, which would instantly unlock one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits on the planet.. Pebble‚Äôs last resource estimate (Dec 2017) clocks in at 6.46 B tonnes grading 0.40% Cu for 56.9 bln lbs of copper, plus 70.6 moz gold, 3.4 bln lbs moly and 344 moz silver. With a market cap of just ~1 billion, that works out to an EV of only roughly $0.016 per pound of contained copper ‚Äì versus the $0.16/lb average paid in recent M&A for similar assets.. Macro tailwinds are enormous. For example, President Trump‚Äôs 50% tariff on copper imports kicks in August 1, 2025, explicitly to ‚Äúrevitalize the domestic copper industry‚Äù and strengthen national security.. **Key upcoming dates to be aware of**. July 17, 2025 EPA status report, if they greenlight additional info, the intention for veto withdrawal could follow fast. August 1, 2025 50% copper tariff goes live . And in the unlikely event that the settlement falters, Northern Dynasty and Alaska will push appeals. Alaska even petitioned SCOTUS in July 2023 to overturn the veto (direct bid was denied Jan 8, 2024) but can re-route through lower courts and back to the Supreme Court later, inevitably in my opinion the Supreme Court will overturn the veto but this would take many years to play out.. The bear case is they have filed for an offering for a total of $75 million, currently they have a good amount of cash on hand from selling royalties on gold/silver production and I suspect they will want to raise money on a big pump following intention to withdraw veto to fund initial assessments and put themselves in a better position to negotiate with a larger mining player to finance development in exchange for sharing the profits.. Full disclosure, I am holding shares (30k exactly at $0.65 average) and looking to sell half above $4, in the event of approval to hold the rest long term until production. . [Full share position](. **TLDR: $NAK = regulatory binary + copper supercycle + tariff play + tight float = asymmetric YOLO. High risk, MASSIVE reward if they pop the veto or win in court.**"

"I put money into RH ~5 years ago. This was my ‚Äòplay‚Äô money account and never considered it my ‚Äòserious‚Äô money. . Through various life events, things got more and less stressful with this account. It was especially stressful after the account reached ~100k in Jan/Feb 2024 and I was locked into $MSTR calls. I cashed out and saw those calls become worth over 800k.. it was very stressful thinking about the woulda/coulda/shoulda. So naturally, I chased it just to piss nearly all that 100k away throughout 2024 on various ‚Äògambles‚Äô because I thought I knew it all. . Long story short. Everyone was hating on Boeing (many people still do). I saw an opportunity. I started investing in long calls. It‚Äôs not particularly ‚Äòfun‚Äô to invest in a blue chip stock long calls like you crazy 0DTE‚Äôers do, but I consider it a great American company. And there are tax benefits to long term vs short term gains (capital gains tax). . I can easily see Boeing going (much) higher, and I hope it does! But it‚Äôs not worth the stress at this point in my life. Maybe I‚Äôll buy shares, but mostly shifting most of this money into long term boglehead moves (boring). I did leave a couple bets on the table though. . TLDR: don‚Äôt gamble with money you‚Äôre not willing to lose. Know when to call it, win or lose. Good luck "

"I‚Äôve watched **$1.5 million in unrealized gains disappear since this post**. That‚Äôs not easy to stomach.

It was a belief in a therapy that could give kids more time‚Äîtime to breathe easier, to hold onto strength a little longer, to live a little fuller. Deramiocel isn‚Äôt just another drug on a spreadsheet. It‚Äôs a shot at preserving heart function in boys whose bodies are failing them far too young.. I respect the FDA‚Äôs role and the need for rigorous data. But celebrating this setback? Cheering the $CRL like it‚Äôs a win? Behind this company are scientists pouring their lives into something meaningful, and families holding onto the possibility of something‚Äîanything‚Äîthat could slow down the heartbreak.. So yes, I‚Äôm down big. But my pain is paper. The real pain is the one that‚Äôs been prolonged for parents watching their child fade without options.. **And that‚Äôs exactly why I‚Äôm still long.**. Because I believe in the data. I believe in the team. I believe HOPE-3 will deliver what the FDA needs to see. And most of all‚ÄîI believe these families deserve a shot at a different ending.

OpenAI to release web browser in challenge to $GOOGL Chrome
This is great!! Perplexity is releasing one too. Google's lawyers who are defending $GOOGL breakup should write these guys a thank you letter! Maybe even send them a gift card.
"Doesn‚Äôt matter if this browser will be a success, but $GOOGL -10% confirmed"
Pretty bullish news for $GOOGL
"Here you go: . OpenAI is close to releasing an AI-powered web browser that will challenge Alphabet's (GOOGL.O), opens new tab market-dominating $GOOGL Chrome, three people familiar with the matter told Reuters.. The browser is slated to launch in the coming weeks, three of the people said, and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse the web. It will give OpenAI more direct access to a cornerstone of Google's success. . If adopted by the 400 million weekly active users of ChatGPT, OpenAI's browser could put pressure on a key component of rival Google's ad-money spigot. Chrome is an important pillar of Alphabet's ad business, which makes up nearly three-quarters of its revenue, as Chrome provides user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably, and also gives $GOOGL a way to route search traffic to its own engine by default.. OpenAI's browser is designed to keep some user interactions within a ChatGPT-like native chat interface instead of clicking through to websites, two of the sources said.. The browser is part of a broader strategy by OpenAI to weave its services across the personal and work lives of consumers, one of the sources said.. OpenAI declined to comment.. The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.. Led by entrepreneur Sam Altman, OpenAI upended the tech industry with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in late 2022. After its initial success, OpenAI has faced stiff competition from rivals including $GOOGL and startup Anthropic, and is looking for new areas of growth.. In May, OpenAI said it would enter the hardware domain, paying $6.5 billion to buy io, an AI devices startup from Apple's (AAPL.O), opens new tab former design chief, Jony Ive.. A web browser would allow OpenAI to directly integrate its AI agent products such as Operator into the browsing experience, enabling the browser to carry out tasks on behalf of the user, the people said.. The browser's access to a user‚Äôs web activity would make it the ideal platform for AI ""agents"" that can take actions on their behalf, like booking reservations or filling out forms, directly within the websites they use.. TOUGH COMPETITION. OpenAI has its work cut out - $GOOGL Chrome, which is used by more than 3 billion people, currently holds more than two-thirds of the worldwide browser market, according to web analytics firm StatCounter. Apple's (AAPL.O), opens new tab second-place Safari lags far behind with a 16% share. Last month, OpenAI said it had 3 million paying business users for ChatGPT.. Other AI startups like The Browser Company and Brave have announced AI-powered browsers capable of performing actions on a user's behalf this year. Perplexity, a well-funded startup known for its search engine, also launched its AI browser, Comet, on Wednesday.. Chrome's role in providing user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably has proven so successful that the Department of Justice has demanded its divestiture after a U.S. judge last year ruled that the $GOOGL parent holds an unlawful monopoly in online search.. OpenAI's browser is built atop Chromium, Google's own open-source browser code, two of the sources said. Chromium is the source code for $GOOGL Chrome, as well as many competing browsers including Microsoft's (MSFT.O), opens new tab Edge and Opera (OPRA.O), opens new tab.. Last year, OpenAI hired two longtime $GOOGL vice presidents who were part of the original team that developed $GOOGL Chrome. The Information was first to report their hires and that OpenAI previously considered building a browser.. An OpenAI executive testified in April that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if antitrust enforcers succeeded in forcing the sale.. $GOOGL has not offered Chrome for sale. The company has said it plans to appeal the ruling that it holds a monopoly.. OpenAI decided to build its own browser, rather than simply a ""plug-in"" on top of another company's browser, in order to have more control over the data it can collect, one source said."
"Challenge $GOOGL Chrome by using its very open source engine developed and maintained by $GOOGL (Chromium)? Can't make that shit up. If they actually manage to kill Chrome, are they going to newly sponsor maintenance of the Chromium project, the way $GOOGL does now for all the other free-riders (Edge, Opera, etc.)?"
$GOOGL is King.
$GOOGL to $165 atleast confirmed üìâ
"They will integrate gemini within a month in chrome, hands down $GOOGL has best distribution and they are going to come out winning even in this race"
$GOOGL is cooked
Honestly from a UI standpoint if all they do is build-out Chat-GPT and allow you to browse webpages from within it then I'll try it out. . Take the same app they have and add a browser seemlessly and they could change things. But it needs to be $AAPL levels of seemless and they need to talk with computer companies about being the new preinstalled default browser for business reasons.. ChatGPT use is really high. If they implement the browser well enough then people won't even notice.

I hate how many people keep posting $UNH calls because I keep buying shares
Should‚Äôve done 500 shares or ATM leaps for Jan2027 instead. I am extremely bullish on $UNH but idk about $540 a year from now.
Playing with $UNH while the Mangione trial plays itself out seems incredibly risky and dumb but that also probably means it will make this dude millions.
"I just want you to be sure you‚Äôre aware of the exposure here. This is 24,700 shares long $UNH at ~500.. that‚Äôs $10M. You‚Äôre ~100x leveraged. Why not a lower strike price‚Ä¶ maybe ~10x leveraged? I get the play, i want you to win, but this is a little too optimistic. A 50% run wouldn‚Äôt even net you a gain and that would beat 95% of stocks in the market.. I recommend $450 strikes."
$UNH has to go to over 540 to make him money?
Trying to learn options. So $UNH has to exceed $540 per share before July 2026 for this to be profitable?
Not touching $UNH till Jan 26. Still curious to see if client companies start leaving $UNH to go to other providers and if the investigations come up with anything.
"Can‚Äôt really go up until earnings clarity. If they were somehow double billing, $UNH gonna have a bad time."
So brave.  I bet you think $GOOGL is a hidden gem too.
I lost $1200 last month of $UNH calls. I still feel sick.
Should have bought $CLOV calls instead. Good luck
Don‚Äôt you think that $BB bill will have an effect on the future earnings? Good luck!
If you are convinced why not sell some naked puts on $UNH around $250 to finance the trade? Surely a bit riskier but the cash from the puts could reduce your cost to zero. A move to $400 would be very profitable if it happened this summer.
"$UNH will probably keep cutting and cutting their workforce in order to improve short term earnings.. But remember that things are still generally negative for $UNH. Increased scrutiny over their billing practices = less revenue over time. Poor reputation for denying services = less growth. Lack of comprehensive specialty care & hospitals = less growth potential; they will lose customers to systems that can provide the whole package. $EMR switch to epic = a short term decrease in quality and quantity of service, but will eventually improve in long run.. The only plus side is that they don‚Äôt own hospitals, so they‚Äôre not as effected by the medicaid cuts as their competitors."
"not a good week for $UNH, but I believe you"
There's no way lol. $490 $MAX
Literally seeing so many $UNH purchases on here and the stock tanked today lol. WTF guys?!?!?
"Yeah, I‚Äôm on the same thought process as you. I converted my whole $UNH position into leaps."
What you might be missing is $UNH will have to increase benefit payouts to prevent future lawsuits. This will erode earnings
I can assure you $UNH is going under and no providers are accepting their insurance anymore

"TO THE SO-CALLED ""MANAGEMENT"" OF ARBY'S,. It has come to my attention, and the attention of MANY, MANY PEOPLE, that the service provided by your establishment, specifically the Arby's near Mar a Lago is, frankly, A DISASTER.. Last night, I ordered a meal and it was delivered to me without the PROPER DIPPING SAUCE. This is an OUTRAGE. A TOTAL DISREGARD for the customer. The HORSEY SAUCE? It was GONE. Like so many jobs under previous administrations. This is UNACCEPTABLE! We have THE BEST SAUCES. People love them. They tell me, ""Sir, your sauces are the best."" And then Arby's forgets them! SAD!. And let's not even MENTION the napkins. ZERO. NONE. Not a single napkin in the bag. Do you know what that means? It means I was left with a mess. A HUGE, NASTY MESS. The LOWEST BAR. And Arby's, frankly, FAILED.. This is a clear example of your company's unwillingness to provide a RECIPROCAL and FAIR exchange for my HARD-EARNED MONEY. We pay GOOD MONEY for your food, and we expect GOOD SERVICE in return. NOT this KIND of service. This is a BAD DEAL. . If you continue with these policies of NEGLECT, this complete LACK OF ATTENTION TO DETAIL, then we will have NO $CHH but to reconsider our relationship. Believe me, we have options. MANY options. Other fast-food establishments, tremendous ones, are just waiting. They want our business. And they will provide the sauces. And the napkins. GUARANTEED.. You need to MAKE THIS RIGHT. IMMEDIATELY. Consider this a WARNING. The American people DESERVE better.. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER"

"After 4 long years of holding and building my position while selling calls and CSPs, it feels surreal to see so much more positive sentiment for $SOFI. FINALLY. Execution has been consistently solid by the management team, but it‚Äôs just not had the love like other stocks. I fully accept there‚Äôs been plenty of potential opportunity cost by holding this position, but IDGAF. This is just the stock that I believed and it is what it is. Zero intention of taking profits, and will continue selling CCs and using the income to buy more. "

"Southeast Asian Super App like Uber and $AAPL Pay had a lil Vietnamese hyper-baby.. Currently the market leader in transport and deliveries and a growing payment service we can see big growth over the next few years.. I visited Vietnam in late last year and as soon as I landed, everyone told me this is the app to get. All the locals, all the expats, especially all the tourists get this app as soon as they land and they use it for everything. Food, transport, payments, it is a massive, massive app. And looking at the tourism data over the past year earnings should be strong.. In Q1 2025, the number of foreign visitors to Vietnam surged by approximately 30% year-on-year, reaching more than 6 million arrivals, the strongest quarterly performance to date.. This will directly affect GRAB‚Äôs bottom line. Earnings are due end of the month and we can see a huge stock surge if we get a surprise based of of the increased tourism money. Tourists spend much more than the locals do leading to big revenue gains for GRAB. They are all using GRAB to get around and get their noodles delivered to their Airbnbs‚Ä¶.

Only upvoting because I see $UNH.
"Good luck. I don‚Äôt love this play because $UNH on the payer side is just a top target by a lot of people. Paying pass through fees to $UNH is becoming a problem, and the lawsuits about shorting benefits as well. I think $UNH will have to increase payout approvals to avoid lawsuits and also clients may choose alternative companies. It looks attractive because of the rapid drop but I worry there are fundamental drivers for it that became apparent"
"I think $UNH is a bad move, I believe if it was inside out good company, after the huge fall after the DOJ probe... the price would have easily recovered. . For $GOOGL, I am very very very bullish on this.. "

". Here's a shrek emoji instead of a wall of text. DD for anyone interested in learning more: [. still holding, price target is $43. see you tomorrow.. Update:  . Follow my portfolio in real time on AfterHour¬†[. Since updating that I'm holding via screenshots is getting old, I linked my portfolio to afterhour. You can follow my position in real time and verify that it's real. Nothing to hide, basically just buy shares and hold, not trying to dump (don't think my size is significant enough to cause a dump anyways).¬†I genuinely believe the stock is undervalued. As of 7/9/2025, the closing price is $4.05 and market cap is $913M. That's still a wildly low and undervalued market cap for $SANA given the market opportunity and the success/significance of their human and preclinical data."
"Why would someone buy this over $CRSP, who is also working on a T1D cure? $SANA straight up doesn't have enough money to bring this to market even if it works 100%. They're going to have to dilute massively in the next 6 months or so, just to keep the lights on."
I hopped on the $SANA train. No inmunosupresor cure for Type 1 diabetes. Strong executive team. $JPM targets at $12. üöà
"Glad to see some $SANA representation here. I‚Äôm an OG, been buying since shortly after the IPO. Been a brutal run but I‚Äôve averaged all the way down to $6. Holding this one to the grave strictly out of principle and blind belief. Lots of upside potential."

$PROK squeezing
"$CAVA is the new chipotle, and I‚Äôm willing to bet on it. Just back from vacation and heading to the street in a month, which means this is my last month of pure freedom before I‚Äôm shackled to institutional trading restrictions, brooks brothers suits, and long term delta one strategies.. FWIW, being a wsb degen is more fun than most institutional roles. I wonder how long before I blow up this billion dollar hedge fund by leveraging them to the tits."
$CAVA 18k gains
Chipotle needs to seriously turn around the hate they‚Äôre receiving or $CAVA is gonna gobble up their market share. Smaller portions & triple the price = everyone I know including myself went from going frequently to every once in a while
"I'm slowly loading up on $CAVA, hope it does something!"
"I disagree on the cmg comparison. I went to Cava for the first time as a try the food before I buy the stock and everything was like $20 or close to it. I walked out and that ended my thoughts on the stock. For background, I make 6 figures and still thought it was expensive. Meanwhile, chicken bowl still cost around $11 at Chipotle. I'm also the guy that didn't buy the $CMGO ecoli dip a decade ago so I'm probably wrong."
$CAVA is not the new chipotle. The fast casual ‚Äòlunch bowl‚Äô market is the next micro-brewery market. It has become oversaturated and middle class consumer spending is slowing. I work a half mile from the original $CAVA and have never been once when there‚Äôs better lunch options like Moby Dick/ Mezah/ Naz‚Äôs Halaal. Don‚Äôt get me started on ‚ÄòAnd Shawarma‚Äô ü§§ü§§ü§§  My next chipotle stock is Potbelly since it‚Äôs also in plans to expand from 400 to 2000 shops nationwide and their ‚ÄòPotbelly Perks‚Äô rewards and mobile app is better than what Chipotle offers

"Feeling great about this entry point for $CAVA. Fast growing, 400+ locations, opening 60 more this year, 1,000 locations by 2032, and every $CAVA I‚Äôve ever been in is packed! Excellent income statement and balance sheet trends. It hasn‚Äôt participated in the recent rally, but it appears to be putting in a bottom and recently there was some bullish options activity from bigger players. Thinking about buying some long dated calls as well at about $100 strike."
$CAVA 2x play
**Seems like you‚Äôre really bullish on $CAVA With that many locations and how packed they are it‚Äôs definitely appealing Buying calls sounds like a smart move  just gotta hold and wait for it to take off long-term**

Teach you from buying overpriced stocks like Tesla.....people buying $PLTR gonna learn the same lesson
All on $TSLA. You‚Äôll make it back by the 18th.
Full port 2w calls on ATH $PLTR . I hereby declare r/wallstreetbets degeneracy is halfway back. . Good luck and god speed fellow regard.
My hero. $PLTR üöÄ
Theta going to eat this away like no other if $PLTR does not pump after it already pumped
All in on $PLTR calls? That‚Äôs either giga-brain or pure insanity. I‚Äôm here for it. üöÄ
It was between $140 $PLTR 7/11 calls or $SMCI $50 calls and I went with the wrong one go figure.
!remindme 2 weeks $PLTR $165 is regarded
Gone full regard on $BBAI hype. YOLO wish me luck
$BBAI is one crony contract away from greatness there are worse bets out there.
$BBAI to your money üòÇ (sorry couldn't resist)
"$BBAI has shown some strength the last few sessions, including today."
$BBAI sell signal confirmed. Thanks OP.. Ill jump back in at around $4 a piece
$BBAI to the moon or my therapist‚Äôs next client. Let‚Äôs gooooo!
I did the same with Cadence (17k) and $UNH (3k). Market only goes up?
" I bought in at 6.5. . I have a collar on my $BBAI position (max downside 7.5 per share max upside 10 per share). I‚Äôll be rolling my collar if it continues moving up. And if it tanks, I‚Äôll re-enter after it stabilizes."
"3mo returns look like this for a lot of companies, including $NVDA"
Will $ABAT be next multi bagger? Or ampx and a at in the different fields?
"IM BULLISH ON COST, $WMT, and $AMZN"
$RKLB üöÄ
"So let me get this straight, I sold $SOFI at $14.00 and $NVDA at $137 to full port into a once in a lifetime opportunity with $UNH and this is what I have to show for it after a month and a week? +3.14%? Jesus Christ!"
up 37k on $RKLB today!
Sir Peter Beck built a strong one. $RKLB üöÄ
You bought $TSLA puts after a $20 drop? ü§Æ
"Guys! I got 2 interview invitations for internship today! . One is British Columbia Investment  and the second one is $SNX Bank. . If I get offer from both, then which one should I go for? üòã"
How to become exit liquidity.. Step 1: Buy $WOLF.. Step 2: Hold overnight . Congratulations! You have became exit liquidity
$RKLB almost 700% gains in 1Y. but i chose $LUNR instead üò≠üò≠üíÄüíÄ
"While the market was busy crashing, $CRCL jerk gang was having the best goon session."
$TSLA is still up 33% the past 3 months on literally nothing but bad news and a distracted CEO. Plenty of dump left.
">TESLA CHINA SOLD 71,599 VEHICLES IN JUNE(+0.8%Y/Y),   . $BYDIF SOLD 377,628 VEHICLES, +11 % Y/Y  . $TSLA CHINA EXPORTED 10,115 VEHICLES(-13.8%Y/Y)  . AND $BYDIF 85,957 (+218%Y/Y). Bro trust me Tesla doing so well in GYNA. /s"
"Next $TSLA pump, going deep into puts for August. Next earnings is a drop."
Bloomberg is fkin ruthless with their interviews lmao they‚Äôll bring someone on to talk tariffs or whatever and then cut them off mid-sentence like I HAVE TO STOP YOU THERE WE JUST GOT MANUFACTURING $PMI FOR AFGHANISTAN HOW DO YOU THINK THIS WILL AFFECT THE AFGHAN 2 YEAR BOND
$TSLA is a political party that makes overpriced cars.
It‚Äôs pretty perverse how you can get a literal YouTube ad of 30 minutes of political propaganda. How much do these advertising Goebbels propagandists even pay $GOOGL for this stuff
Oh fuck... my $CLBR calls..... are green
$NVDA 160 COME ON
Dave Portnoy bought $10M worth of $TSLA shares. $TSLA to 100 confirmed
$CLBR seems immune to tariffs news. . Show em your GREEN BIG D $CLBR
$UNH YOU COCKSUCKER ü§¨
$RKLB was less than $5 this time last year. LOL
Name a more iconic duo than $TSLA and retail pumping its price in afterhours.
$UNH finna be bout tree-fiddy soon.
Mah boy $RKLB bringing the dough!!!
I would like to wake up tomorrow to $GOOGL being at 180. One can dream.
"today was somewhat irksome in that while my $RKLB, which I hold but hate, and my $OKLO, which I hold but don't care about, both increased in value, my precious $IREN did a bunch of weird annoying shit and my beloved $NBIS $GLXY duo got their dicks stomped deeply in mud"
$TSLA too high
Muskolini gonna get all fuk up on horse tranquilizer one night and start calling someone a Pedo.. $TSLA gonna drill.
have never bought $TSLA before. Will I regret these calls
I‚Äôm thinking of buying $BBAI cause I hate feeling left out. Reminds me of middle school ;(. wtf is this shit. I‚Äôm kinda retarded
You? Bitching when $AMZN takes too long to deliver. Crying when the UberEats driver's delayed 20 minutes with your Chipotle.  . Bitch I used to wait days for a single song to download on Napster.  . **We are not the same.**
$RDDT
"$RKLB held up my port today, not sure if that's good or bad"
"$GOOGL opens at 172 tomorrow, $AMD goes to 145 tomorrow, WOLF bears in disbelief when it hits 3 tomorrow. No one is happy, except for the people who paradoxically made money while being regarded and shouting ""told you so"" -- you'll feel so out of touch with reality that you consider buying crystals and changing your name because of the 10 minutes you spent reading about numerology.. I leave this question with you: what product would you buy if it was endorsed by Pedro Pascal?"
Damn my $UVIX calls might print
Oh boy am I glad I moved 50% of my port over to $RKLB last december. (Its still a small number)
Looking to open a savings account with 0.38% interest so I will buy $GOOGL shares instead
"Damn, $PLTR used to be a penny stock üò±"
Yall tryna play catch up when there‚Äôs enough companies to invest in like $CLF
ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ ppl who buy put when market make new ath ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ you should short $BTC also
$TSLA PUTS. Oh Lord. Catch me if I fall.
We can bury him next to the guy who bought $GOOGL puts the day it was down 9% and said ‚Äúthe sell-off is just getting started‚Äù
Premiums on the weeklies are jacked. Was waiting for a good opportunity to buy in puts but kept seeing strong support at 290 and especially at 270. I think $TSLA starts to rip back to 320 from here. Take this with a grain of salt $TSLA is so hard to predict lmao. Best of luck though!
"I am not a $TSLA fan, but premarket is not lookin good for you bro. However, anything can happen, good luck!"
Noooo not $TSLA. It never makes any sense.
"I am an owner of $TSLQ and that printed today. I think there's more room to run, but I'm probably taking some gains... I agree long term that $TSLA falls. The next earnings call in a few weeks will be fascinating."
"Almost looks like $TSLA is gonna bounce between 285 and 320, just give it 2-3 weeks and you should be gucci"
Big fan of $TSLA
"This is my third and final attempt at a DD. My first two got taken down by the mods. Give me a chance. We all now know that the Big Beautiful Bill BBB just got passed, and it brings big changes to how gambling losses are taxed.. Beginning in 2026, gamblers can only deduct 90% of their losses, meaning even a break-even or losing gambler could owe taxes!!!!!!. I personally believe this will tank professional gambling and it‚Äôs about to send gambling stocks (DKNG, $PENN, $MGM, $CZR, RSI, etc.) into a nosedive.. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. New Gambling Tax Rule. Old Rule - You could fully offset gambling winnings with gambling losses. Win $100K, lose $100K? $0 taxable.. New Rule - You can only deduct 90% of gambling losses.. If you win $100K and then proceed to immediately Yolo it onto red and lose $100K. You‚Äôre still taxed as if you won $10K.. ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. Consequences. Many professional gamblers will step away from the sport along with many average people like us who win very little or even lose.. Yeah, this is fucked and I don‚Äôt know why I don‚Äôt see more people talking about it.. Side note: I still believe people will want to gamble to scratch that itch. They will just end up doing it offshore using cryptos and or buying stock options like us degens.. I will be taking out margin Monday to buy puts and will post on Monday at open my portfolio. Play Puts. $DKNG $40 7/25/25 $ 1.21. $DKNG $42 1/16/26  $5.43. $DKNG $40 11/21/25 $3.88. "
People gamble because they are addicted. They don't care about taxes.. $FLUT and $DKNG long leaps.
Hope this hits and $DKNG eats the curb
Not significant enough a change or a change that‚Äôs happening immediately to have an material impact on the stock price near term. You‚Äôre going to get smoked. Get out and wait for an entry to go long on some $LPTX puts and be happy with the double digit gains.
If so then $HOOD should be the hardest one hit. Because that‚Äôs all it is.
"I‚Äôm actually long $DKNG puts as well. . I‚Äôll be solely using Bovada (offshore) or Robinhood (Event Driven Sports). . It‚Äôs not hard to bet $50K to $100K in notional a year. . I‚Äôve had many break even years, and now I‚Äôll have upwards of an extra $10K in taxable income?. Nah I‚Äôm good."
$TSLA once in a three weeks buying opportunity
Exiting my $TSLA puts last week was certainly a choice. üíÄ

There just isn't a Bull case for $TSLA anymore man
Market is roaring into safety stocks like $CVNA
"Bought 2000 shares of $AMD this morning into a near instant $1500 loss. Rode the ride back up and exited for a $770 profit.. Bought 2000 shares of $UAL right before the tariff news hit, instantly down $2200. Rode the ride back up and exited for a $110 profit.. $880 total profit and it only cost me 2-3 years of my life expectancy."
"I've gone full blown stupid now, I bought $CLBR"
So fun owning $UNH and $GLD leaps and never making any money on them #blessed üôè
*The first batch of tariff letters has been sent today. I let the countries know that ALL their citizens that are shorting SPY must have their brokerage accounts CLOSED and they will all receive a*¬†***Cuck***¬†*flair on WSB. The foreign bears are DESTROYING America and this shall not be tolerated. This action has to take effect IMMEDIATELY or we will place a 69% tariff rate on them. Countries will benefit from a REDUCED tariff rate if they buy $NVDA calls. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!*
Market rotation from speculative meme stocks like $TSLA into quality insolvencies like WOLF
We getting the suicide hotline gonna get posted for the $TSLA bulls?
$RKLB continues to shine on.
Still impressed that $TSLA is only down 7% after Elons performance ... The amount of passes this guy gets is crazy.
Mango Jr. $CLBR podcast tonight. Let the grift begin!!
"$TSLA corruption trade is finished, there is literally 0 catalysts now; going long would be going full retard"
$TSLA crime pump incoming
# $GOOGL needs to learn from WOLF and file for bankruptcy so that they can 4x their stock
"Instead of dumping bonds, I guess the Japanese are dumping their $CLBR shares. "
$BULL trading at 13$ premarket and y'all be acting like its price has collapsed. 10 days ago it was below 10.50 for god's fucking sake zoom out
Some of you here don't own $CLBR shares and it shows
I don't think people really understand how bad this can get for $TSLA. A personal beef with ü•≠!? That man cancels funding for any organization that inconveniences him and is the most vindictive thing to walk this earth. $TSLA could be targeted by the prez! Enjoy justifying the P/E ratio now..
Sold my $TSLA puts because I have paper hands. Go make me regret it $TSLA bears
