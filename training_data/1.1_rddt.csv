Cramer buying $TSLA at these prices LMAO good luck tslatards
And $CLBR is gonna finish the day +4% haha so many ppl were cheering when it went down
$TSLA WILL BE KNOWN AS THE MOST CORRUPTED AND MANIPULATED STOCK IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF AMERICA. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION ON THIS MATTER
now watch this $GOOGL Drive
"Honestly thought $TSLA would have dumped harder at open, are we going to close green today"
There are YouTubers that have made an entire personality out of owning $TSLA stock.
"I‚Äôm stupid so all I see is dip buying opportunity on SPY, $TSLA, $HOOD. Selling puts."
$RKLB pumps so hard when Elon shits the bed LMAO
"Russian minister dismissed under suspicion of embezzlement, found dead in his car of 'apparent suicide', gunshot to the head. His weapon was found in a storm drain, where he threw it after dying from his wounds.. $TSLA 250p"
"My office just got donated an *absurd* PC for AI work. This thing has 3 Nvidia A100 40gb, 512 gigs of ram, 9 terabyte $SSD, and an Intel Xeon Platinum 8352Y x64. Good lord."
When is $LUNR crashing some shit on the moon again?
"Imagine being a $TSLA investor who held on to shares after melon begged everyone not to sell, only for the prick to go around and start a flame war with the prez"
I just bought some $GOOGL. The only company with actual robotaxis. Elmo is fucked
$TSLA Bulls in denial that they have been turned into long term bagholders
That second $WOLF pump was not in my bingo card
"If you don‚Äôt start to pump $GOOGL, I will be using Bing from now on"
i should have just bought and hold $PLTR instead of fucking around with options
"Holy shit I am getting killed today. -10k, so far.. Shouldn't have sold my 1000 $RKLB shares."
Which one of you regards said $CLBR was going to 20?? Come out here I just wanna shake your hand
"$TSLA stock taking a fat shit is an infinite money glitch, every single time it dumps, it‚Äôs bought up within 24 hours"
$TSLA bros microwave salmon in the office lunchroom
"I want to thank $TSLA ""investors"" who believe in flying cars and shit"
BULL rugged. $UNH rugged. $CLBR literally singlehandedly carrying my port rn
"welp i guess $TSLA bears win, that 2nd Epstein tweet probably aint gonna make the stock go up now, Elon saved your puts"
$BULL
$TSLA down to $50
Thinking about getting back into $TSLA puts 5 minutes after I sold tbh
"should have known $GOOGL will dump, far too many posts on wsb about being bullish on $GOOGL"
"I bought SPX puts.  I  bought SPX calls.  both are deep red.. In fact, the only sensible thing I did was buy $CVNA calls.  Only green in my portfolio."
i somehow sold the top on $AAPL this morning thank the lord i think im done for the day made $80.
Who's still winning on $RKLB because it's most of their port?
"We're back in it. Im glad i didn't hold over the long weekend, but we are back. Nearly $30K $MSTR YOLO into earnings. #LET'S GO.  . *Not gonna go through my reasoning again. If you know you know. If not, go look through my last post here.*"
$MSTR YOLO x2
$MSTR earnings are 100% meaningless
"Damn bro, and I wanted to short $MSTR at 400 lol (didn't pull the trigger)"
People who keep calling this a ‚Äúponzi‚Äù are the same people that would call Bitcoin a scam lol. Personally I think $MSTR will go a lot higher than $500.
$MSTR options are a scam. Even when you're right your ass will still get fucked. Unless you're buying after it being way down
I have a big put on $MSTR. We gonna have some fun together ü§£
FUCK EVERY HATER. $MSTR TO 600
Wow! I think $UPXI is the next $MSTR. 
$AAPL can only go up from here
"$AAPL always goes up heading in to earnings and then regardless of what happens, it drops like $5-$10 right after."
"this could be interesting to see, as I myself currently divest and shift away from $AAPL. good luck üëç¬†"
"Just opened Robinhood, threw my rent on $AAPL calls too. If we go down, at least we go down together."
"If $AAPL goes down, I‚Äôm switching to Android out of spite. Diamond hands only."
Yeah $AAPL is bullish
$AAPL will go up at the first crumb of good news about their ai. It won‚Äôt take much. . But they certainly have taken some big hits right to the face lately  for sure
Nice one dude! $AAPL is down
I have shares. $AAPL has been lagging the rest of the mag 7.. safe haven too in case the market goes maomao because of tariffs.
So many $AAPL bears in here reinforcing my belief that this is definitely going up.  I have quite a few $AAPL leaps and I am feeling pretty confident in them.
"I‚Äôve seen $AAPL ‚Äòonly go up‚Äô since the iPod days. Careful, those green lines don‚Äôt last forever."
So my $TSLA calls are saved?
"Just bet on another delay, should have done that for every ""deadline"" they set since Feb, would have made more on that than $TSLA puts."
$NIO OPTIONS
"**109 buys on the $17 call? Someone really wants $NIOIF to moon or go broke, no in-between.**¬†"
"I don't get it. So you're confident it gets to $15+ by January 2026 but only to $7+ by January 2027. But ok maybe you bought them at different times.. I am bullish on $NIOIF and have LEAPS and shares but I don't think it will hit $15-20 range by January, not that soon. That said, I would so want to be wrong on this."
Based on... what? What makes you believe $NIOIF (a company that only loses money and has been losing more money each passing quarter) is going to roll past $20?
"$NIOIF is a shit ass, you really had to pick the dead horse huh?"
Why are you so confident in $NIOIF in particular? Give us a short summary
I have shares in $NIOIF which I bought at an average of 10$. The price action is pretty frustrating and has been only downwards for many years now
"In my experience, people investing in $NIOIF are never fans of the cars. They usually just fall for NIOs tech propaganda.. NIOs are unpopular and brands like $XPNGF and $BYDIF with Xiaomi coming up are much better cars (granted $XPNGF and Xiaomi just stole the inside from Tesla)."
I hopes this happens. I have been waiting for months to get rid of all $NIOIF shares. All it need is to get up around $7 and Im happy to sell all of this shit.
"I bought $1000 worth of shares on $NIOIF a few months back, and I feel like an idiot.. The degeneracy on display here is next level."
$NIOIF needs to be on 60 minutes again like last time¬†
dang I didn't know I could be writing $NIOIF calls to 20 year olds with dad's money
Why are you betting against ‚ÄòMERICA? Buy some $INTC like a true patriot
"$NIOIF is in a big crisis this year, I have a small position, but keep monitoring the status"
"Rookie numbers, bro.  I was down over $71K from the failed mission this year.  Luckily, I was playing with the house's money from last year's $LUNR gains (over $250K).  It still stings.. This one will move again this year.  I'm going to try to make it all back on $LUNR alone.. "
Might as well gamble with $BULL
"I just bought a bunch of $LUNR calls expiring in september, maybe it will take off now. im praying."
. $JOBY-WT is a leader in eVTOL. Buy the best and YOLO.
It's time for YOLO in $JOBY-WT
Soon you'll be applying for a $JOBY-WT at Wendy's.
Top is in when regards start advertising $JOBY-WT again
$ACHR is a good play too

$TSLA -20% tomorrow
Elon really couldn‚Äôt have launched this before the holiday last week? My $TSLA puts got cooked and expired üòñ
"Maybe in the end it was about the money we lost along the way. In my case, $75K on $TSLA poots in 2021. üíÖ"
I'd rather fly economy and use instead the $2000 more I would have spent in business to buy 0 $DTG. . creates anticipation during the flight.
"It might seem rational and logical to short $TSLA, but remember the stock is anything but rational.¬†"
When TACO inevitably tweets back at Elon it will probably send $TSLA down another 5%
$TSLA 300p gonna print!!!
Elon has been shorting $TSLA at $488
"On futes that are open after tariff delay announcement.. Futes Green:. * DAX. * $CAC. * FTSE. * Euro Stoxx. * $ASX. * $MSCI. Futes Fuk:. * US. Futes Confused:. * Nikkei. The money is leaving Mango, what are you doing you big orange oompa loompa, The money doesn't like this fuckin instability."
$CLBR what‚Äôs the deal?
$TSLA always tanks the day after my puts expire. Almost like clockwork.
She‚Äôs a 10 but she is unironically bullish on $TSLA.
$CLBR to 20 tomorrow
This week I‚Äôm shorting $GOOGL because they can‚Äôt set up my fucking internet properly

Calls on $TSLA because sometimes you just gotta do the craziest thing to out crazy the obvious
"There are so many commercials for medication for eczema.   I feel like not a huge percentage of people suffer from eczema, and those who do most likely are already prescribed medicine to treat it.   Really odd to pay all that money for the ad time for all of us to have to watch the commercials.   The logical conclusion is that the margins are quite high treating eczema.   The margins are most likely huge for all cream medication as the COGS can be tiny, factoring mass production.  - Anyway, $TSLA 200 -"
$AMD to 170 in the next two weeks. Thank you for your attention to this matter!

Well I mean $BTC is up near ath so the indexes will probably go up too. Calls until August
If you are not in $IREN then I cannot help you.

"I'm long $HOOD and get the hate they get. But I keep getting comments that totally misunderstand the issue with OpenAI objecting to tokenizing their shares. It was a bit cheesy but if you are at all serious, do take a look at the announcement video in Cannes. Vlad actually did a great summary on a chalkboard about how this all works.. \- Tokens are backed by real assets. In OpenAI case, it's the SPV shares owned by Robinhood. RH maintains custody. It's basically a promise to sell the shares to the token owner when public.. \- This is only in the EU. Mainly because in the US, we have stricter ""accredited investor"" rules. In fact, this even applies to you today and forbids non-accredited investors from participating in these sorts of private offerings. It's really a space for the wealthy. One side is ""but we have to protect retail (dumb) investors."" and the other side is ""retail investors are smart and understand the risks or at least free to make their own choices."". \- The SpaceX and OpenAI tokens were given as a promo gift and can't be traded. It was more of a representation of tokenizing private shares. It was 5 minutes of the hour long announcement but 99% of the post announce discussion.. \- It was amazing how quickly they did this and stock/etf token trading is available now.. \- Perpetual futures will be here in a couple months as well which is huge. Typical of RH, the UX is fantastic and intuitive.. \- People are also glossing over the fact that they were pretty much Crypto only in Italy, Spain, Lithuania, Poland. US & UK have brokerage. NOW, they just **released in ALL 31 EU/EEA countries**. . \- They launched tokenization of assets which is huge. People that don't understand think tokens are just made up out of thin air. They are not. They are backed by the real asset and just make transacting more seamless. In fact, phase 2 in a couple months will allow 24/7 trading of tokenized assets. Then phase 3 also in a couple months, you can actually custody your own tokens on your own wallets, swap, etc. They are starting with stocks/etf's. The openai/spacex was an example of something a little different (private shares). They also mentioned real estate and art. Again... any unique asset can be tokenized. I hear stuff like, ""well, what if they tokenize my house?"" Sure, if they owned your house. Again, they own the private shares of OpenAI/SpaceX. They basically took $1M worth of their owned tokens and distributed it as a promo for signup. Sure did create a lot of FUD though.. Bigger picture is that tokenization of real assets has tremendous potential even beyond stocks. Launch in all EU countries so quickly is a major growth factor. New capabilities like perpetual futures and 24/7 trading are in very high demand. Yes, RH pushes boundaries but they are also large enough to know how to work within regulations. btw... in interviews at Cannes, also talked about how supportive the new SEC was and they have a seat at the table. I feel tokenization of assets is here to stay and will be expanded to the US this year. (just my opinion). . "
$HOOD and all the OpenAI FUD
"Love all the hate and bears coming out of the woodwork for $HOOD, chart still looks amazing for a move significantly higher and that's all I care about. . People were bearish and hated $PLTR at $60, $80, $100 etc and they're back to being quiet now lol."
This is terrible and you'll lose a fortune sooner or later if you are this loyal to $HOOD
$HOOD to the moon real soon
"Tokenizing shares is basically acting as a bookie on the price direction of shares.  Anyone can do that.  I can do that, which is to ""be the house"" and make a market in something I don't own.  Like taking bets on next Sunday's football game score.  That is nothing at all like owning the actual shares, though for day trading and casino-mentality it probably doesn't matter.  This is not much different than the mortgage security game played before the market crash in 2008.  Trade securities based on options in a security that isn't owned.  Third derivative. Roll the Dice.. Why not offer a tokenized Bitcoin?  BTC's main attraction is its limited number of potential coins (21M) based on its algorithm which makes each successive coin harder to ""mine"".  But any financial company could offer tokens against Bitcoin and increase its availability infinitely.  So what is unlimited Bitcoin worth?  Zero.  This is the way to destroy any equity valuation above its asset (book) value.  Sell tokens and it takes away the scarcity value of any equity.  This is why OpenAI (Sam Altman) is fighting $HOOD against tokenizing its own stock.  This is a very bad idea for markets."
"""It's basically a promise to sell the shares to the token owner when public."". Is it, though? It would make some kind of sense if it was that, but so far I haven't seen terms or a contract statement that says that, just general language that the value of the token ""follows"" the value of the asset in some unstated way. An SPV is mentioned, but not what it actually does. If the shares are never made available to the public, does $HOOD promise to buy the tokens back? At what price?. Maybe this is all written down somewhere in detail and legally binding and all, and I just haven't found it. I would love a URL!"
$APP & $INOD
"Added a bit more today.. From a technical perspective - $APP chart is conflicting. Either H&S or large Cup and Handle‚Ä¶.I would argue cup and handle with strong fundamentals.. $INOD looks like it wants to break through $52. A good quarter and we‚Äôll have lift off. Sizing it smaller given the risk associated with it. If $INOD prints a good quarter and forecast well, will lean into it after earnings and into the rest of the year."
"Most investors don't know what lies ahead for $ACHR because they are seriously lacking when it comes to doing their own DD: imagine a company that costs $10, has Palantir, Stellantis and Anduril as partners and is not only in the air cab business, but also in the military business.. # How do I know the time has come?. Because behind all the marketing, the truth is that their agreements with Palantir and Anduril are top secret, but they have been dropping several hints along the way:. * In the video Archer uploaded celebrating the 4th of July, they used an N703AX aircraft model, and one of these models was recently sold in 2025, I suspect to Anduril or the US army.. * Think about it: why use precisely this model in the video on the Independence Day of the United States?. * On July 4, the big beautiful bill was officially signed, which means that Palantir and Archer now have a free hand to build together the AI Foundation for the Future of Next-Gen Aviation Technologies.. * On June 26, 2025, Sean Duffy said the signing of the big beautiful bill is the first step in building A Brand-New Air Traffic Control System.. * Additionally, Archer has reiterated countless times that they plan to begin commercial operations by the end of 2025, and just a couple of days ago they moved one of their aircraft to Abu Dhabi and flew it for the first time to test it in extreme humidity and temperature conditions.. * To top it off, on June 6, 2025 Trump signed an executive order to incentivize drone production in the United States, mentioning eVTOLs in several of its sections as the protagonists of ‚ÄúAmerican dominance in the sector.‚Äù. I was the one who wrote the original DD when Archer was around $3, everyone at WSB laughed at me, and I have a suspicion that history is going to repeat itself once again.. My position:. "
The time of $ACHR has come
"The stellantis investment, might be overrated. The Boeing investment might be underrated. They are a massive defense contractor as well as the largest US exporter. . They could be looking at a future buyout, depending on how the military and civilian applications pan out. . Commercial air taxi and service to an entire metro area. Smaller more frequent flights.. Military, current weight capacity of a 4 person flight is maybe 1,000 lbs. that‚Äôs a 4 person spec ops team. It could also be configured in multiple formats with weapons systems.. Also $ARKB capital just took a position as well, about a month ago. The financial press love Cathie Wood. That might help as a pump to the stock price.. I‚Äôm long $ACHR. 3,000 shares"
"question from someone who doesn‚Äôt know anything about eVTOL: . - what makes $JOBY-WT less attractive . - why is their excessive advertising (olympics, Jimmy Fallon, Usher) not a red flag . - and unclear changes to the aircraft‚Äôs propellers/equipment . can you clear these up for me?"
"The aircraft that they ‚Äúflew‚Äù in Abu Dhabi is the one they only made hover for a minute and never actually flew in any way, right?. Isn‚Äôt that also the old model they rushed over to ‚Äútest‚Äù because they didn‚Äôt actually have any current models ready to fly? Can‚Äôt have $JOBY-WT stealing all their Middle East thunder. Have to do something to stay in the spotlight. . I‚Äôm too lazy to check on a Sunday but are you the one who‚Äôs been pumping $ACHR every weekend on r/stocks or are there just multiple pumpers who make a post every weekend trying to get people to buy? And why is it always ACHR? I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve seen a single $JOBY-WT pumper despite them being the better positioned company"
"Puffed up, speculative (at best) company. At least $JOBY-WT has something to show for it. With that said, calls."
"When you‚Äôre so dumb even your chat gpt slop has little to go off of üíÄ . That being said, I like $ACHR but they have a long way to go"
"This is regarded. $ACHR is only investable when they‚Äôve brought price per mile down to land travel. Until then, you‚Äôre lighting your money on fire via dilution into a bottomless pit.. If you need any more reasons to not buy this, Cathie buys $ACHR. üòÇ"
Buyer beware. Op is a mod of $ACHR and bans anyone in that group that dares to question the status quo.. 
"I don't know what is about $ACHR but there are consistent posts from few accounts trying to push narratives about it, also, if you post in the $ACHR some rational argument that the stock shouldn't x20 in a month they just ban you.. I am not sure if the evtols they have will fly but people there are super high regardless.. Might be a good short play if Grump tries to grift infrastructure and says evtols are the new thing."
$JOBY-WT will far outperform $ACHR
"Archer should be seen as a PLATFORM for advanced air mobility, a company capable of attracting funding from American institutions to create an American leader capable of acquiring all others, including drones. All managed by applications developed jointly with $PLTR. Joby has become too Japanese due to its dependence on Toyota."
$PLTR owns 19.9% of Surf Air Mobility as of last month. There's allot of overlap in the software side of things which is the scalable part.  So If I'm investing in things that are meme stock adjacent I'd probably pick Surf Air Mobility
My port is 95% $ACHR and I've had free shares since 5.70. $ACHR retire me
"BEWARE BEWARE BEWARE. $ACHR-WT fakes are trying super hard to sell their shit üí© to retail.. Archer is going bankrupt by 2027 as they don‚Äôt have product. What they have is hype, PR, marketing, dreams but no execution.. Even regards should stay away from this."
"Friends- leave Archer for Joby. I‚Äôm not in Archer and heavy on Joby but keep watching both closely just not become blind follower of Joby.. This is more of same from Archer.. At this time I have concluded that Archer is ONLY interested in dick contest with Joby and trying very hard to stay relevant through PR, flashy update.. Sad‚Ä¶ we need real players n competition but seems eVTOL is becoming one horse race in USA.  Maybe Beta will join when they ready to transition from wing borne to vertical takeoff.. Friends I keep saying this whenever I see Archer getting hyped‚Ä¶. They are mostly style over substance.. PR over progress.. Promises over delivery.. Misleading vs Factual. Etc.. They don‚Äôt have certifiable product. They has one prototype which is has been exploited as showpiece than actual testing‚Ä¶.and their second prototype is having major design changes than first one‚Ä¶. They product is too heavy and cannot $VTOL so now they showing hat as CTOL.. Lastly for what it matters Cathie/Ark has invested here and this is also recommended by Jim Cramer!!. This cult has setup separate sub r/ACHR where if you asked question they ban you."
"I think Joby will beat $ACHR, but military applications sounds cool"
"When I last posted the day before the Robotaxi ‚Äúlaunch‚Äù that featured only 10-20 vehicles, supervised drivers in the passenger seat and teleoperators on standby, I listed a bunch of reasons why I felt $TSLA would drop in the ‚Äúnext few weeks‚Äù:. Although I didn‚Äôt foresee the absolutely regarded retail pump the day after the launch, I did what anyone with balls should do:. I increased my position even more.  My $60K put position is now a nearly $72K put position.  I cashed out of my July puts and loaded up on August puts.. Why did I do this?  One of my catalysts was that Elon would antagonize TACO again.  This has played out exactly as I expected and then some.  An ‚ÄúAmerica Party‚Äù now means Elon is TACO‚Äôs enemy.  This is insanely bad for all of Elon‚Äôs companies, from $TSLA to SpaceX to X.ai and everything else.. Now that Elon has gone nuclear, not only will equity values of all his companies plummet, but Elon will likely have to sell more $TSLA shares to fund his new political party.. I expect a big payoff for my August puts now that $TSLA is without any meaningful positive catalysts until after earnings on July 23 (at least).. Between now and then, more and more people will realize:. 1.  How devastating the Big Beautiful Bill will be to TSLA‚Äôs 2026 cashflows with the $7,500 EV tax credit expiring and the seemingly instant death of regulatory credit sales.  $TSLA may lose money on a $FCF basis as early as next quarter but almost certainly in 2026.. 2.  Elon and TACO are both loose cannons and can pop off at the mouth over a hurt ego at any moment.  Tweets trigger the algos.  THIS WILL BE A CONSTANT OVERHANG FOR $TSLA GOING $FORD.  Momentum will be very difficult to ignite now that Elon has pissed off most of America.. 3.  The true launch of Robotaxi with no teleoperators/supervised drivers will take MUCH longer than most of the Cult followers think.  Each state (including TX) will have different bars for $TSLA to clear in order to operate at scale.  Those bars just got higher with Elon starting The America Party.  Given that $TSLA is only a Level 2 ADAS technology, there‚Äôs a lot of trial and error before they can operate at scale.  One accident and ensuing bad PR, will send the stock plummeting.. 4.  Optimus won‚Äôt be a popular product (if ever) until $TSLA can have the robots operating at much more human levels (movement, comprehension, performative actions, etc.).  The Asians are way ahead on robot technology, the same way they are now way ahead on EV manufacturing/quality.. For all those that say ‚Äúbelieve it or not, just buy calls‚Äù, $TSLA is now down ~17% YTD.  The S&P 500 is up 7% and even the pathetic Russell 2000 is up ~1% YTD.. So please, by all means, keep telling me I‚Äôm stupid and that I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing.   Keep buying your calls even though deep down you know you are just burning your money due to the fact you are in a CULT.. I‚Äôll keep shorting every nonsensical rally that you regards trigger as $TSLA continues its overall downward trend back towards 150-200.. "
$60K on $TSLA Puts‚Ä¶Upped it to $72K
Hell yea - with you with my July and August puts. Dip started Friday and $TSLA will tank next week.
Great move!! I also have been buying puts on $TSLA and cashing in. I don‚Äôt hold my positions multiple days which is just my preference I sell once I have 10-15% profit. I buy 3 contracts ATM with 4-5 $DTG. I use support/resistance as my entry points and it‚Äôs been working well. $TSLA is in a downtrend based on the daily and we have a better chance of seeing 285 then we do 350. I only trade Tesla. It is the only stock I trade.
Don‚Äôt bet against $TSLA. Catch ya behind Wendy‚Äôs!
!RemindMe 40 days. +120 $TSLA 15 AUG 25 250P 100
I‚Äôve been burned too many times shorting $TSLA. Thanks but no thanks Lmaooooo
I'm going to keep buying $RKLB.
Why Tesla and not $MSTR or CRCL?. $MSTR is worth 2x the underlying $BTC they hold
"When $TSLA runs/dumps, it's a big move. Always take gains after a 20%+ move on $TSLA"
$TSLA puts are gonna print.  Nice job OP.

The only bad thing about your $TSLA thesis is that there‚Äôs too much logic in it
That guy could sell 0 cars end of quarterly and stock would still be optimistic. I try to avoid $TSLA
"$TSLA burns me, when you think its tanking it claws its way back up.  market manipulation"
GG I followed‚Ä¶i‚Äôm sure you are gonna close tomorrow though if $TSLA gaps down?
No one cares that you happened to be right about the timing with $TSLA this time. Plenty before you have created reasonable DD just for the stonk to do whatever the fuck it wants.¬†
Ha! Expecting $TSLA to make sense. That's going to end well. Gl anyway
"$TSLA always recovers, all it takes is Elon tweeting something bullish. I would close sooner rather than later."
You are going to be the reason $TSLA pumps again lmao. TURD DD üí©
You are exactly what $TSLA stock awaits to devour. You wait and see.
"I've been thinking about the potential of these two companies. $ALT has their weight loss meds fast tracked meaning they could get approved at any time for pempemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist, which is in Phase 3 trial for the treatment of obesity and metabolic associated steatohepatitis.. The stock got hit over its weight loss report. It was ridiculous because it was based on 2 low doses. $HIMS has been hit after Novo said it was forcing customers to cheaper compounds. Alt isnt a big pharma company so it will sell cheaper. Compound pharmacies will be forced to stop at some point. All doctors who have been making a fortune are looking for alternatives because people want the drug cheaper. I haven't seen people on the diet drug  rav since phen-phen. Not only that but you have to take these drugs forever. . POINT here is that Alt will have to compete with the big boys but if they get into bed with Hims they will have a leg up. I love Hims because I believe management is quite intelligent and I can honestly believe they are watching Alt. . I already had 450 shares of Alt and 100 of $HIMS but plan to increase now. "
$ALT and $HIMS
"Years ago Martin Shkreli did a series of videos on how to analyze a binary event (e.g a clinical trial) IMO a useful watch if you can find them. . My primary question about $ALT is if their drug is acting on the same pathways or following the same method of action as approved drugs? . Surprisingly people seem to try drugs that work on the same protein receptors even after previous attempts at targeting those receptors fail to yield results. If it is targeting the same receptors, and there is evidence to support it will actually interact with them it could be a good buy."
$ALT is a full on gamble
$ALT has a  40% gap up. It's a volatile stock that has been filling gaps on both directions
$ALT does not stand out anyhow waste of thought tho
"Why would $HIMS customers or anyone in general take [Pemvidutide]( Aren't there already better GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonists from better companies? . Also, aren't there drugs in the pipeline that are much more lucrative, like retatrutide or even some of NVO's drugs?"
Here I am with $HIMS puts. I just feel like they are overvalued and should be at $36. Lawsuit with Novo coming up in August and their quarterly projection looking just ok. Just waiting for someone to find out where they are sourcing compounding illegally.
Been holding $GLD and GDX since gold was $1700
I'm balls deep in silver options ATM. But I was considering $NEM calls for earnings as well just last week.  These will print
$GLD leaps expiring in Jan 2026. Probably will buy again for 2027
"100 Shares of $GLD, I have held since Spring, I sell covered calls on occasion. . $CDE (silver mining mostly but gold as well, I trade in and out of it as it swings a lot. Sold quite a bit at 8.9 or so, maybe wish I hadn't. Still hold some, was hoping it would dip and I would buy back in. . I will take a look at $NEM, Is there a foreign owned mining stock worth taking a look at? It would be nice to benefit two ways from a future spike in gold and drop in the dollar."
"I‚Äôm going to go back on $GLD Monday. . The Vietnam deal, while better than liberation day, is worse than the last 90 days. If that‚Äôs what success looks like I‚Äôm expecting Wed to be red or at least some risk off. If not from stocks then bonds with BBB signed."
"$WPM, GDX, and $PSLV for me"
$NEM & Gold calls
i suggest $GROY too
Yep have had $KGC for a while now. Up 92% so far
$NEM I have a spread that is wayyyy in the money. might buy more
Why $NEM over other gold mining stocks?
"Honestly, I think $GLD is going sideways for the next 4-6 months.. $GLD is very good at being choppy for months on end."
"$NEM and B (Barrick) have suffered trailing performance compared to sectoral peers such as $AEM and the large South African miners (Anglogold Ashanti and Gold Fields).. I think $NEM earnings won't be anything spectacular compared to other majors, although they may benefit from a pricing mean reversion tailwind within their sector over the coming months."
"i'm long $BTG, $FSM, and $TFPM. no one talks about $TFPM. (not a mining stock though. it's a streaming/royalty company)"
"How are they chosen though?. I remember it once said: $TSLA, SPY, HIT, TEL, AVIV . That was a good one lol"
We seeing $BBAI running next week too?
Oh hell nah $TSLA this guy gay ash
I have a female friend  who works in politics in DC. She works as an assistant to some scrub politician. She said  she heard talks about a $BTC standard. The rollout will be partial (10-12% of Current GDP). Has anyone heard similar?
Not a fan of $TSLA
you don't like $TSLA yet it is 89% of your portfolio? Congrats regard! buy more shares to average down.
I'm my experience these $TSLA dips aren't very sticky
"U.S. manufacturing expanded for the sixth consecutive month in June, with the S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing $PMI reaching a three-year high of 52.9. This was higher than the forecast of 52.0."
As far as I know he deleted his account. I have $INTC in my watchlist because of that guy. he could have just sold during the tariff dip and bought $NVDA and would have been even.
I raise with the guy that dropped a few millions into $UWMC a few years ago
He's making a comeback by dropping his other grandma's inheritance on $INTC before their Q3 earnings.
!p $INTC
"What about the guy who bought 30k worth of useless .5DTE $BULL calls? I‚Äôm bullish on BULL, but even I think that was regarded."
The dude that always talked about carrying boats and went from begging on a sub to making a million on $MSTR then lost it in like two days. I think his username was Elon loves you on something like that. That was pure pain
If he put them in $ASTS he‚Äôll do pretty well‚Ä¶
$BBAI is worth looking at.
You people of little faith.. He probably hasn't sold $INTC yet - ultimate ultra diamond hands.
"so if he full ported $INTC at $31 with 700k, he would have 22,580 shares, which is now worth 506k"
Thousands of stocks and he picked $INTC to invest in! Imagine if he‚Äôd put that in HOOD! I think that‚Äôs the platform that he used to invest Nana‚Äôs $$$$
"I bought INTL during the Great Recession and held it like 10 years. Made 20%. üò¢ . I had considered $AMD at the time but nah, they weren‚Äôt making money. Some of you will know what an error this was. . I did atleast buy some $AAPL and Starbucks at the same time."

These few months had made my portfolio almost breakeven for my all time chart. Long have the times gone where I've held options down to -100% and become margin called. . I'd like to thank $NVDA and $HOOD for the largest contributors to my gains and hope they continue to rise. üôè 
Powerful $NVDA Gains
Margin called 800 shares of my $NVDA shared sold at a 20k loss. Good times ü•≤
 LET‚ÄôS GOOOOOOOOOO! $NVDA TO $5000 AND BEYOND. I‚Äôm not selling.
It‚Äôs basically a money glitch buying $NVDA calls huh?
$NVDA is basically $CSCO from the .com bubble. Watch out
$NVDA really carried the entire market this quarter. You timed it perfectly. Curious ‚Äî were you playing shares or ITM calls?
Damn I bought $NVDA as a meme and now I‚Äôm scared to sell. This post isn‚Äôt helping .
"Anyone to talk to about options? I have $NVDA, I have approximately a 51% return, but if I had actually bought options, and not the stock itself, how much would I have had?"
"Besides hope, you can also consider checking out an AI I found a couple of weeks ago called EyeQuant. It seems pretty good so far ‚Äî it tells you once a day after the close which S&P 500 stocks are beginning an uptrend. For example, it signaled that $NVDA started an uptrend on May 13th, and since then $NVDA is up about 18%. According to the AI, that trend is still in place. If you register, it also notifies you when the uptrend ends. What I also like is that it shows the backtesting of each signal over the past 7 years, so you can see how reliable it has been historically and decide for yourself. They don‚Äôt receive any money, they just provide the information.. If you want to check it out, here‚Äôs the link [www.quantsoft.cl/eyequant](. Wish you luck!"
Damn I bought $NVDA as a meme and now I‚Äôm scared to sell.
$GOOGL position 2122 stocks now
I‚Äôve been buying only VTI for the last 9 years and have almost $365K. I plan to put 1/4th in $GOOGL on Monday. I think the market is going to realize it‚Äôs undervalued very soon.
"shares of stock, or shares - not stocks. $GOOGL is a stock."
been thinking of selling my $AAPL for more $GOOGL what do u think?
$GOOGL will double in two years good move
"For WSB standards, this is a useless ass stock. For long term and non regard portfolios, good on you! It's going through the phase $AMD had a couple months back."
So you now own 2122 shares of $GOOGL. Why not show us the picture of the 2122 shares after versus showing us the 1000 shares before?

From a consumer point of view Elon starting a new party is bad for $TSLA because it takes his focus away from the company even though I doubt he does much. With that being said bad news is always good for $TSLA so +5% Monday prob.

"Let me begin by saying I don‚Äôt like the stock or the person associated with it.  The company is trash and makes no money.  With that said, the technical setup for this week is extremely bullish.  The stock is oversold and had a clear reversal off the trend line from September of last year.  It closed near the high of day on Thursday with elevated volume.  Average recent volume is 8 million, and 8.61 million shares were traded on a half day Thursday.  It is currently sitting right below the 20 $EMA.  A break above on Monday on elevated volume will be my confirmation that its breaking out.  If it‚Äôs rejected, I‚Äôll stop out most likely.  Jane Street, the firm that was just banned from buying and selling stocks in India because of manipulation, bought 16.5 million shares(7% ownership) of the company very recently(5/29).   18% of the float is shorted.  We‚Äôve seen violent, fast upward moves in the past with this ticker, as it doesn‚Äôt trade on fundamentals whatsoever.  I‚Äôm betting that one is coming shortly.  I‚Äôm not saying buy shares or invest long term, just put it on your watchlist and keep an eye on it.  "

I wanted $TSLA to go down significant amounts and I wanted to profit off of their demise. I realized not too long ago that the stock market will go up no matter who is in charge. It's true that stocks only go up, and it usually takes a company going bankrupt for a stock to actually go down in significant ways."

Used one of these ai chatbots to review what the sec filing was all about and thought it be better to keep til Friday when the private notes closed instead of selling when it was 75 the other day. Glad I did! Took some profit today and bought some $MSTR and $GLXY (not pumping anything but surprised more people aren‚Äôt talking about $GLXY, they have bitcoin, own data centers, and work with Coreweave, like am I missing something?).

He claims the code runs a bot that snipes new tokens--theoretically finds newly listed tokens, buys them before anyone else does, then sells them just as quickly to make a profit.. Sounds too good to be true and it is.. If you study the code, what it actually does is funnel the fund you put into the smart contract into his wallet. The code tries to hide the receiver wallet address behind several layers of convoluted code.. It is an interesting adventure. I've messed with Solidity and smart contracts in college, so I have a spidey sense for what is possible with smart contracts and this seemed too scammy..

$HOOD call will print
"Enough suckers put in money, it becomes legit by buying some private equities.. Note that, this is the long term strategy for $MSTR. Saylor is going to cash out about the half of the Bitcoins and buy gold."
"No they aren‚Äôt stock.  . But Robinhood did explain how they were different, and perhaps OpenAI should ask ChatGPT to explain to their own management what this actually is and how it works and then maybe their panties would be so bunched up.. Long story short:  It works essentially just like any other broker handles stocks.. When you buy shares of $AAPL at your broker, you don‚Äôt hold those physical shares in your pocket, your broker holds them for you.  You have a contract where the broker pinky swears that the stock belongs to you and not them, but really‚Ä¶ you aren‚Äôt placing your hands on that stock certificate any time soon, if ever.. With this new Robinhood stuff, it‚Äôs just like that, but with crypto added in.  Robinhood holds some OpenAI equity and is parsing out promissory notes via crypto coins that Robinhood associates with it. Not a huge difference, just some technology and asset changes. You still get to trade the asset the brokerage holds as if it‚Äôs yours, but you‚Äôre going it with crypto instead of code running on a Schwab server.. Is it a scam? I don‚Äôt know, nobody outside Robinhood knows. But on the surface, it‚Äôs no more a scam than a traditional broker is."

"Yeah $DDOG trades at 13√ó sales vs S&P average of 3√ó‚Äîbut Profitable, growing, and now in the 500 club. That‚Äôs the future"
"Soo, $HOOD next month then"
"There are so many competitors in this space. While Datadog is known as the flagship and has a price to match, copy-cat companies rip off their new features within months for a fraction of the price. I don‚Äôt think $DDOG has any kind of moat."

Good. Fuck $HOOD
$DDOG - 46B mcap for a company that literally just provides service for logging/log files? Am I missing something here guys? fkn highschooler could write up such service?!
I think $HOOD went a bit out of hands and big investors want to bring down the price to at least 40/50 to make a safe purchase. Let's see what Trumpito AKA Taco comes up with to drag the market down and make another entry point.

Any 0 $DTG RECOMMENDATIONS FOR TODAY
Spy ATH and $AAPL fading
The amount of people in here talking about $GOOGL as if it were a short term play boggles my mind.. The google dip is a buy and chill affair.  A leaps thing
Is $GOOGL just incapable of getting back to its ATH? I've been holding so long I'm accumulating shares via dividends. This was not the plan.¬†
$NVDA is insane lol
Well guess my $TSLA puts are absolutely cooked.
Starting to think my 0DTE $TSLA puts weren‚Äôt the brightest idea. Felt cute when Tesla dumped almost 1% but now I‚Äôm cooked
CALLS ON $AZZ
All in on $AZZ
What does $AZZ do?
Must resist the primal urge to full port $AZZ
Bought 1k worth of $DAL puts
$DAL bears crying so bad rn
"$HELE puts, no one buying a $300 backpack."
I just made this post not knowing that $SMPL was even a company or that their earnings were this week. Do with this information what you will. 
Lemme get that $AZZ
I got no $AZZ this quarter so puts
"I feel like these companies just had earnings! I checked my notes and 3 months ago I bought shares for $KRUS and Delta during this week and $KRUS went up 30% and Delta went up 20%. Stocks usually do not repeat big moves like this 2 quarters in a row so beware. If you study past earnings moves you can see trends quarter to quarter since a lot of the moved are dictated by hedge fund computers. I chose $KRUS and $DAL b/c they satisfied a 3 checklist criteria I put together, it was not a random gamble."
"Playing $AZZ.  One of the major players in galvanized steel and construction is going to be big rest of the year, I think they will have great guidance forward."
Getting penguin calls because I like penguins.  May use the same rationale for $AZZ
I hope everyone got their $DAL calls in as suggested üòé
"$LEVI earnings report. ""Thursday's guidance assumes Tariffs on imports from China remain at 30% and are 10% for the rest of the world"". They are not factoring the 30% Tariffs announced on Bangladesh and other few countries days ago"
$DAL Puts till Wednesday and calls on Wednesday
I heard $AZZ is gonna let lose and dump on everyone üôÅ
"$CAG probably continues going down. Don't know how that CEO still has a job, he literally dumped all their most profitable divisions since he took over which is how despite losing 30% in share price in the last year they are at annual lows have a PE ratio over 30."
$AZZ earnings Wednesday
"damn my $DAL calls would 5x, what earnings should I bet on next to 5x that again? Levi's or WD-40?"
I'd say $AZZ would be calls but it's already at an all time high...
I feel like $WDFC is gonna rip this week. So puts it is
"I'm a fucking moron but, is $ETWO actually a buy? I mean, they have some pretty huge contracts, ~600m revenue ~1bil market cap.. Edit: yep I'm a moron they're being acquired at $3.30, that's why... Makes sense. I'm all ""why are September $4 calls basically free??"""
$DAL calls the right move?
"$SMPL seems to be range-bound for god knows how long. It shots up like almost every earnings, now SP is sitting at the bottom. It can be worth of a shot.. "
"The morning dips are pretty good opportunities to play earnings...just buying $DAL 7/11's, or $SMPL 7/18's would have 3x'd if you bought on the dip after open. Earnings were decent for both"
Delta actually did good on their last earnings and the only ones to have balls to have the call while market is open. Calls and sell $CSPI it is.
Calls on $AZZ
"up 400% on $BRRN puts. free money. any time there‚Äôs earnings for some company you never heard of, puts is the way."
Fuck it $DAL picking up some calls here
Look at the options movement for $DAL in the last week for August and July monthlies.. Edit: July and September
Full port $AZZ
Chatgpt told me to buy calls on $AZZ
$DAL calls and $LEVI puts will be my parlay
"Calls on $DAL, $BRRN, SMPL(maybe best one), $HELE, $WDFC, $PSMT."
I have a few shares of $PENG and it's been hustling.  . Will be an interesting one to watch Tuesday night.
$PENG
Looking forward to $RDDT soon. Just placed my bets üôÉ
$SMPL with an 8.49% move since the morning low lol. I think I‚Äôm going to hold until share price is at least 38+ though.
"\> held $SMPL calls  . \> chickened out by market's reaction  . \> sold for 50% loss  . \> $SMPL immediately rose to $33. God, I'm regarded."
$60 $VIST calls. $15 $LEVI puts
You guys are too funny. Everyone on $LEVI puts üòÇüòÇ

$AZZ getting clapped
"Looking at $HELE, call is tempting."
It‚Äôs all about that $AZZ today
calls on $DAL calls on $CAG
calls on $LEVI calls on $VIST EZ
"\> said everyone that calls are a correct move for $LEVI  . \> decided to reverse myself, ""it can't be THAT easy""  . \> bought puts. It was THAT easy, duh"
Hold this till open $DAL come onnnn
Puts $AZZ and $DAL
How are we feeling about $LEVI puts
$LEVI PUTS. Put the dog down
$DAL puts?
$BRRN calls i think.
What‚Äôs the move up for $AZZ tomorrow !!!!!!! Let‚Äôs gooooo
What the hell happened to $SMPL and $AZZ
How're we feeling about $ETWO 4$ calls.?
Bought some $AMD calls for a week out on a whim last Friday. Its been a good day after a tense week down.
thoughts on $LEVI
Also on $LEVI puts
$LEVI bears getting ass blasted.. Anyone who inversed is getting 300% tomorrow.
Can $AMCX stock spike can be repeated?
"Found the best puts to buy. $PPLT being an industrial metal would be affected by Trump's tariff uncertainties (bearish). Not only that, it recently went up a lot, way too much, which gives us another reason to short it."

Yet $TSLA is up.

$TSLA puts and $UNH calls are probably the play
All these people buying $BULL on other brokerages.
Became a long term investor in $UNH at 328$. Sad Pepe
$UNH is such a troll. How does it pump like 10 dollars yesterday and drops 18 dollars the next.
$BULL.
I will never not laugh at how many people buy puts on $TSLA after it tanks then get shocked when it goes back up lmaooo

You know what‚Äôs crazy. Go back to any wallstreetbets post (or any other investing subreddit) from 2023 discussing $HOOD when it was trading for under $10 a share.. Anybody posting a bullish position on $HOOD got crucified by this subreddit. Downvoted to oblivion. Now suddenly it went from being the ugliest dog in town to the prettiest girl at the dance..

"Hello friends, I'm back. Here is $UPWK, $UPWK and my explanation on why I bought $150K+ in shares.. At first, you see what looks like¬†a CAT. It starts off with the two ears. Looks like a cat right?. Wrong. This is the NINE TAILED $FOX Pattern, not just any cat. So as usual with the destruction of the hidden leaf village, $UPWK had some rebuilding to do. A massive dump candle hits like Pain himself.. But what they don‚Äôt see‚Ä¶ is that the chart needed this. Naruto HAS ARRIVED. You can see his hairline being formed in the chart. Which means, Naruto/UPWK is about to have some serious plot armor in the upcoming weeks and months.. You know what comes next. Naruto meets Tsunade. They didn't show this in the show but there's a bouncy entrance and the Chakara Massage Experience. Everyone knows there's a happy ending to Naruto because of his plot armor.. For that reason I believe Upwork will breakout $17+ and bought a decent amount. This is fully shown in the TA of the chart for anyone with a $PHD such as myself."
His $OSCR dd was accurate. I would follow OP to the depths of hell.
Bought $150K $UPWK based on Naruto chart pattern? I guess every broker needs a sensei in their life
"While I like the graph you've drawn, I'd like to make a comment that $UPWK has no investment value whatsoever"

You should look at $AMD. It always follows chart patterns pretty well for some reason.
"Large funds are making a ton of money shorting $MSTR. Well, it's time for some news. $BTC is about to break ATH, and $MSTR will have major upside pressure. Once $MSTR breaks the key resistance for fund shorts, it's going to go absolutely parabolic. $MSTR to AT LEAST 600 by August 25th. So many catalysts.  . - Tariffs? What tariffs?  . - Analyst EPS is -12c... But theyre going to have at least 870, if not 900 eps. Wildly an oops on their end.  . - First time $BTC holdings can be shown on an earnings, and this the first time $MSTR will do it. Will show an insane earnings.  . - Significant institutional shorting for options selling. Once $BTC hits ATH, $MSTR will rocket. IV will rocket. Shorts will cover.  . - RATE CUT LIKELY IN JULY.  . I am speculating if $MSTR does jump to 600, i make around 300k-500k, depending on the IV at the time.  . Anyone want to join?"
20K $MSTR YOLO
I did my first options today on $MSTR and bought one contract for 1.00 and sold it for 3.90 so I‚Äôm pretty satisfied I‚Äôm just trying to learn options but I think I‚Äôm gonna go on hard on some of these that expire in a few days.
Addendum. This is $MSTR EPS at any given $BTC price.. 
Ill be open OP. I am got a fuckton of long dated puts on $MSTR. Honest question. Why dafuck does FASB Matter. Not a single cent of digital asset markup is a real gain. Saylor is saying over and over again that he will never sell. So why dafuck does this matter?

This is so obviously a $TSLA bull trap. I would not be buying here lmao
$TSLA should just stop selling cars and hit 500
Goddam $TSLA investors are so fucking dumb. Miss numbers. Rallies 6%.  Insane.
glad I sold those puts yesterday on $TSLA. Company is a fucking joke
This was predictable.  Entire sub was bearish on $TSLA.  I think one smart regard stated that it would moon anyway.
If $GOOGL missed like $TSLA it would be  -99%
$TSLA being green because deliveries are *only* -13% YoY is fucking hilarious. Buying $TSLA should come with a complimentary helmet

With only about 1,000 units built and parts for 1,200 procured, Elon Musk‚Äôs 2024 goal of 5,000 robots is now unreachable; suppliers expect the redesign to take two months. Problems include overheating joint motors, weak dexterous hands, short drivetrain life and limited battery endurance. Leadership has shifted from departing project head Milan Kovac to AI VP Ashok Elluswamy amid wider executive turnover. Tesla hopes to unveil a markedly improved, Grok-enabled third-generation Optimus at the upcoming shareholder meeting to reassure investors.. So... cars aren't selling.

You know this market is legit when $CVNA is up 68% ytd.
"What $TSLA bers don‚Äôt understand is that declining car sales is good for business. It reduces COGS and OPEX via layoffs. Eventually, it won‚Äôt incur any expenses for the car segment when it sells 0 cars, which is huge cost savings. How could you not understand this?????? üòÇüòÇüòÇ"

"Just a reminder. I bought $TSLA calls 2 days ago, it went down 5%.. Now it‚Äôs up 5% the next day, but theta has entirely destroyed me. I‚Äôve lost everything."

"TL;DR: **Redwire** (**RDW**) is basically a bunch of different space focused companies focused on the new space economy. It has fundamentally upgraded its business model by **acquiring profitable defense UAV (fkin drones) specialist Edge Autonomy**. Combined with a recent strategic capital raise (approx. $260M gross), $RDW is now poised for accelerated revenue growth, improved margins (cash flow positive), and significantly deeper penetration into defense and international markets.. # Redwire ""2.0"": The Merged Entity & Strategic Direction. * **Redwire (RDW):** A diversified space infrastructure company providing critical technology (avionics, sensors, power, structures, in-space manufacturing ‚Äì like their cutting-edge antenna capabilities from their Golden, CO ""Golden Dome"" facility). Moonshot potential for biotech like printing organs in space or making drugs. Involved in lots of MARS and MOON **shit**. Making robotics, making thrusters, solar arrays, etc.. * **$6B+ pipeline, $500M+ q1 2025 bids**. **BEFORE** adding in Edge Autonomy. * **Edge Autonomy (Now Redwire's UAV Division):** A proven, profitable manufacturer of high-performance tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with strong existing defense and international customer bases. Key metrics at acquisition: **\~$115M in 2023 revenue**. * Both space and drone stocks tend to trade at 10x p/s. $RDW combined will be at about **5x**. And **EBIDTA positive**. Not too many space or drone stocks can say that. On valuation alone this is a great buy. But really the company is just now unlocking its true potential as it emerges as one of the largest players.. # Edge Acquisition & Recent $260M Offering. The acquisition of Edge Autonomy isn't just a revenue addition; it's a strategic pivot towards higher-margin defense and drone markets. The recent upsized offering (net proceeds intended for strategic growth, repayment of the Edge Autonomy seller note, and partial repurchase of preferred stock) strengthens the balance sheet and reduces certain forms of dilution.. * **DRONE POWERHOUSE:** Edge Autonomy propels $RDW into a leading position in the tactical UAV space, especially for US & allied nations. This offers a counter-narrative to pre-revenue drone companies.. * Think of this like merging with $AIRO except Edge Autonomy is VERY PROFITABLE. * Drones make sense for a space stock. Think about Aerovironment making the mars copter drone thingy. Or all the other lil space robot bros.. * **DEFENSE INTEGRATION:** Strong synergies between RDW‚Äôs space-based intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance tech and Edge‚Äôs aerial platforms. $RDW has reported **350 million**(as of early 2024 reports), a significant portion tied to defense. Edge's inclusion should amplify this. **GOLDEN DOMEEEE**. * **Combined ability to sell to defense departments. Deeper relationships, bigger wins. Dealing with 1 larger company is easier for GSA.**. * **INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION:** Leverages Edge‚Äôs existing international sales channels for both UAVs and Redwire‚Äôs broader space portfolio.. * **BALANCE SHEET OPTIMIZATION:** The recent \~$260M offering (closed \~June 18, 2025) is crucial. Use of proceeds includes:. * Repayment of the seller note for Edge Autonomy acquisition.. * Repurchase of a portion of convertible preferred stock (mitigating potential future common stock dilution from those instruments).. * General corporate purposes and strategic growth.. * This significantly de-risks the balance sheet and provides firepower for growth, making the current valuation post-offering an interesting entry point.. # Financial outlook with 1 example line of business. **Valkyrie Hall Effect Thrusters ‚Äì Future Growth Driver:**. * **Technology:** NASA-licensed, best-in-class H71M thruster tech, commercialized with Phase Four.. * **Market:** High-demand for efficient satellite propulsion.. * **Bull Case Revenue (from Q2 2026):** Est. \~$1M/unit, \~300 units/yr capacity (Phase Four), $RDW 50% share -> **Up to $150M additional annual revenue for $RDW.**. * This propels the 2024-2026 bull case total revenue CAGR to an impressive \~23.0%, driven by high-margin, differentiated technology.. **OTHER LINES OF BUSINESS:**. * Continued leadership in core areas: solar arrays, deployable structures, sensors, avionics, and in-space manufacturing.. * Redwire's facility in Golden, Colorado (the ""Golden Dome"" site for this context), is a center of excellence for advanced antenna and $RFAIR systems, critical for both commercial and defense space applications.. **Here's some of what $RDW does besides the acquisition:**. **Big or Strategically Important Contract Wins (Examples):**. **Future Contracts & Opportunities Important to Win:**. * **""Golden Dome"" Project (U.S. Missile Defense):** Actively pursuing contracts for advanced space-based missile defense systems. Potential multi-billion-dollar program.. * **Next-Generation Uncrewed Systems for DoD:** With Edge Autonomy, well-positioned for autonomous swarming, AI-drones, integrated airborne-space intel.. * **Commercial Space Station Modules:** Contracts for modules (e.g., Orbital Reef, which $RDW supports) for research, tourism, industrial use.. * **Lunar Gateway & Deep Space Habitats:** Continued involvement in NASA's lunar Gateway, developing tech for sustained human deep space presence.. * Honestly the **manufacturing** and **biotech in space** is awesome, and a great moonshot to mention with moon contracts, space station contracts, golden dome, and mars contracts.. * **International contracts** from other countries space programs and private ventures.. * **RANDOM SHIT ($6B pipeline)**. **Acquisition of Made In Space & In-Space Manufacturing Highlights:**. * **Made In Space (MIS) Acquisition:** Pioneer in on-orbit space manufacturing, developed first commercial $DDD printer on ISS.. * **ISS Additive Manufacturing Facility (AMF):** $RDW operates a commercial AMF on ISS, over 200 objects printed in space.. * **ZBLAN Optical Fiber Production:** First commercial product manufactured in space (on ISS) and sold on Earth.. * **FabLab Development:** New in-space manufacturing system under NASA contract for future missions.. * **Broad Manufacturing Capabilities:** Fused deposition modeling, injection molding, casting, stereolithography, subtractive manufacturing.. * **Bioprinting:** Successfully bioprinted a human knee meniscus on the ISS ‚Äì game-changer potential.. * **Drug manufacturing in space:** It is awesome, they have contracts already using their PIL $BXNCP.. # Why $RDW Now?. Redwire's strategic acquisition of Edge Autonomy, coupled with a decisive capital raise to strengthen its balance sheet and fund growth, has set the stage for a potential re-rating.. * **De-Risked Growth:** The offering addressed immediate financing concerns for the Edge acquisition and reduces some preferred stock overhang. There's no warrants. No bullshit. No risk of dilution from here. Just operating a combined space and drone company. * **Clear Catalysts:** Integration of Edge, scaling of UAV defense sales, continued space infrastructure wins, and the ramp-up of the Valkyrie thruster program.. * **Attractive Entry Point?:** The market may still be digesting recent events. As the combined entity executes and delivers on its projected $FCF positivity and growth, current valuation levels could appear very attractive in hindsight.. * **Strong Sector Tailwinds:** Increasing defense budgets, growing demand for space-based assets and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance, and the expansion of the commercial space economy.. The pieces are in place for Redwire to emerge as a significantly larger, more profitable, and strategically vital player in the converging space, defense, and advanced aerial systems markets.. Anyways here some shit I got, and yes I did buy this mostly before the recent dilution (screenshot right after the offering). Disclaimer: This is financial advice"
I‚Äôve been in $RDW for years. I wish I lad loaded more a few months ago when it dipped back to $7
"The company is trading at 1.0x revenue and getting tanked because they have $1BN of debt‚Ä¶ but they just slashed their dividend, sold their remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies (which will bring debt down to $900MM), and they could easily sell their international assets to franchisees (~50 hot light theater shops that could sell for $250MM at $5MM / shop which is a conservative estimate) which could easily delever them down to $650MM, a manageable amount and will take them out of any bankruptcy potential‚Ä¶. there is a long list of strategics (Restaurant Brands, Mondelez, $SBUX, MD) that would pay $2-3BN for an asset of this brand quality. I see the fair value of the stock closer to $10-11 (>200% upside) "

"Just read Cloudflare‚Äôs latest update and I‚Äôm wondering if people are seriously underestimating how big this could get.. They just launched something called Pay-Per-Crawl, which lets any website charge AI companies every time their bots scrape content. They work with 30% of the top 1 million websites and rising.. By default, all new sites using Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers unless the site owner opts in and sets a price.. This basically means Cloudflare could sit between millions of websites and every AI model trying to train on public content.. If this catches on, they won‚Äôt just be a CDN and security company anymore. They‚Äôll be the gatekeeper for AI access to the web.. Could $NET become the toll booth for the AI economy and spin up a multi-billion dollar high-margin revenue stream? Or is this just hype?. "
Nana didn‚Äôt hear no bell. $INTC yolo.
I buy $INTC every time it dips to 20 or lower.  It's a great flip!
"Interesting, I bought some more yesterday to bring my average price down to $24.50.  I may make money yet.. I'm hoping $INTC has hit bottom, which doesn't guarantee going straight up, but better.. Guess the new guy has no problem cutting heads unlike Gelsinger."
$INTC win!
$INTC is going to the moon.  Why?  They hired from the best pool.. Here's one who turned pennies into billions:. 
"You‚Äôre a fucking idiot.. Everyone I work with is jumping ship right now. Yields are trash and we have no customers for 18A. Even the new CEO is now talking about writing it off as a loss.. I literally work for Intel, and $INTC is nowhere in my portfolio."
"Intel and $AAPL are my only positions. I have 47k shares of Intel, and 1,000 of $AAPL. I believe Intel is going to double this year at a minimum. Within 2-3 years it's a 5x. Here's why. The company trades below book value, and everyone hates the stock. But this isn't just a contrarian trade. Intel invested $100B in state-of-the-art manufacturing capacity the past 4 years. They've invested $200B in the last 10 years. Yet their market cap is $100B? Plus, that $200B in spending resulted in $50B in debt. In other words, they have paid off 75% of it. This capacity is coming online. AI is exploding, Demand is 10x supply. And here comes Intel, with loads of capacity nobody else has. Intel is not even relevant in the AI market today, but that is a HUGE opportunity. They can compete on price with so much excess capacity, and they have a massive untapped market to go after. Intel is focusing on AI at the edge, and that is the next super growth area. Intel is right back in it. They will get a big piece of that. They also have new products coming out that are going to be highly competitive with $AMD. Power efficiency is really good with these products, and that also is a defense against ARM's push into CPUs. Why go through all the effort to switch to $ARM from x86 when the benefits are just not there? Intel's products are coming back strong, combined with the foundry capacity, this stock is going to rock. They get one large foundry customer at it doubles. But even without it, they are coming back strong."
"If it makes you feel any better, I bought calls on $INTC on the (unexplained) dip a couple weeks ago and this morning went from up 80% to down 10%.  It was up like 120% last week.  Winnnnnning.. That being said, I'm buying back into the dip with 8/15 24 calls because I'm dumb like that."
$INTC best hope was to hire a Malaysian Chinese businessman. So cooked.
And this reminds me the two biggest employers in my zipcode are $INTC and $NKE.
"Ok, I really like $INTC and considering selling $NVDA and YOLO too. . However, why $1.2M now? Please, tell me this inside trading! üôèüôè"
"You may remember me from last week when I called for $CRCL under 200 on the day, and under 100 in 3 months.. I continue to buy puts at $175 for July 11, 2025. I've averaged in at $8.39 / put. BUT thats not what I'm here to discuss fellow regards. It seems like the gay bear gods have blessed us with another opportunity I didn't see coming this soon.. Say hello to Robinhood. Yes, the ""To Catch a Thief"" inspired presentation was mesmerizing. I was on the edge of my seat, Vlad in a pinstriped suit was a pretty sight, with his tiny sunglasses and a middle aged rich white man potbelly.. So I'm here with my own, ""To catch a..."" spinoff presentation, I call it, ""To Catch a Short"" because that shit was all gas and no ass, all flash and no cash. it was a marketing event and the market fell for it.. **Robinhood‚Äôs tokenized stocks launch is overhyped:**. 1. Robinhood‚Äôs tokenized stocks rollout is overhyped. It is launching to only 150,000 users in Europe, since US regulations still block it. If tokenized stocks eventually become legal in the US, every major platform will jump in, and firms like Backed Finance, which powers xStocks on Kraken, are already years ahead.. 2. The idea that 24/7 trading will meaningfully boost order flow is also questionable. Robinhood‚Äôs own 24-hour market has shown limited traction, and weekend liquidity will likely be even thinner, mostly driven by retail traders.. 3. Some argue tokenized stocks on-chain will enable self-custody and DeFi features like stock-backed lending, but that is already happening elsewhere, for example with bCOIN on Base, and interest so far has been minimal. True self-custody is not possible yet for tokenized stocks in general, since these tokens represent ownership of an SPV rather than direct ownership of the stocks themselves.. 4 Launching its own chain, likely an Ethereum L2, will not drive meaningful revenue any time soon. Liquidity, user adoption, and dApp development are all multi-year challenges. Blockchain growth is slow, difficult, and constrained by regulation and user acquisition hurdles.. 5. People love to lump Robinhood and Coinbase together as retail trading platforms, but their business models are completely different. Coinbase earns explicit trading fees, while Robinhood quietly marks up crypto prices, which is a race to the bottom, especially since Vlad has already promised to remove token markups for tokenized stocks. Coinbase pulls in twice the revenue of Robinhood, yet Robinhood trades at a forward P/E of 66 to 74, compared to Coinbase‚Äôs already high 60x. The price-to-sales is even worse: Robinhood at 26 versus Coinbase at 12, meaning you are paying twice as much for every dollar of Robinhood revenue compared to Coinbase.. **Send it to $80 in a month**"
To Catch a Short: $HOOD Edition
"I mean you were partially right on $CRCL and still in the red what makes you think you‚Äôll be right here. Hood was about to rally today but we saw a market wide pull back, nothing really specific to hood"
"Bro really wrote a whole Bear Bible just to justify his $HOOD puts. Respect. I didn‚Äôt read any of that but I‚Äôm all in shorting Robinhood with Robinhood, poetic as hell.¬†$80 in a month? More like $80 in Monopoly money. Let‚Äôs ride these puts to Valhalla or food stamps. üêªüìâüíéüñêÔ∏è"
"well you are leaving out two things:. - OpenAI and SpaceX stocks. - staking, which can draw a lot of COIN users to $HOOD, especially with the 2% incentive going on. also pretty impressive how fast they integrated bitstamp into their system.

 $HOOD will be $100 soon
"Feel like the capital doing $CRCL is the same as COIN. They have been moving opposite afternoon yesterday. Also, CRCL‚Äôs volume shrink 1/3"
**CRCL puts? $HOOD puts? My guy really hates money huh?**
it dropped one day doesn't mean your thesis is right. this is as stupid as the other guy shorting $MSFT. if i were you i'd get out asap.
"I bought more $HOOD puts.. $CRCL short is starting to shape up well.. Here‚Äôs more proof Robinhood‚Äôs big ‚Äútokenization‚Äù push is just vaporware. In the words of openAI:. ‚ÄúThese ‚ÄúOpenAI tokens‚Äù are not OpenAI equity. We did not partner with Robinhood, were not involved in this, and do not endorse it.¬† Any transfer of OpenAI equity requires our approval‚Äîwe did not approve any transfer.. Please be careful.‚Äù. Like I said yesterday this is a marketing stunt. Robinhood is basically buying OpenAI shares via an SPV and then giving retailers a tiny exposure. It‚Äôs not a product, it‚Äôs a marketing gimmick.. Market will realize soon, we see $80 by mid July. ‚Äî-. Mods said I can‚Äôt do daily posts, so just going to comment here. Let me know if anyone has a better idea. .

"$BAER Bridger Aerospace.. They are an aerial fire surveillance and suppression company. Basically they have planes with huge scooper buckets and recon equipment which is used to fight fire. One of their biggest contracts is with the BOI.. Big Beautiful contains an extra 100 million allocated to the BOI per year for fire suppression services. Now that doesn't sound like whole lot, but BAER's total revenue right now is 100 million. Being awarded even half of those contracts would be substantial.. The former CEO, who is also a senator, put his shares into a blind trust right as the bill was passing the house. Probably to avoid conflict of interest concerns. This is the new age of grift in America and I have no doubt in my mind a Senator who helped get this bill through will be rewarded (with the people's money).. I see the stock going to around $4.50 to $5.50 (125-175% gain).. Position: 1,000 shares"
$ASTS
I would not personally invest in this for moral reasons but the private prison stocks flourish under fascism.  CoreCivic & $GEO are two
Indirect answer is after Trump is done with this his focus will need to go somewhere and that is going to be on continuing to deport brown people and to rattle NATO‚Äôs cages. . So go deep in $PLTR for the data to drive deportations I guess if you want. I‚Äôm focusing on EUAD (Euro defense ETF) as NATO countries increase spending to meet % of GDP demands.
"$GEO will do well. They have around 5000 empty beds and are already a huge ICE contractor. If Homan gets the numbers he wants, he will need 50-75k more beds.  In addition, $GEO does electronic monitoring (ankle bracelets) which 80% margins.  If the prisons fill up, they‚Äôll get more business there.  They also do secure transport."

"Unpopular opinion, $TSLA will become a monopoly without the EV subsidy. Other EVs will die without it. Calls on TSLA!"
I‚Äôm hold spy calls and gold futures. Will sell the SPYc when it passes and the market pops and then go hard into $GLD and maybe Bitcoin. May even get spicy and finally buy those SPYp ive been eyeing
"$NAK continues to make big gains over the last year, feels like they might get approval to break ground, anyone else tracking?"
"Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs in the big beautiful bill, I think it‚Äôs a separate bill, but I personally am doing calls on $CRCL around $250 for 9/16, the bill benefiting $CRCL is allowing companies and banks to take transactions with crypto, and $CRCL is being called the best company that allows companies and banks to help with the transactions, the bill is highly likely to be passed sometime in August, and the high has hit around $260 already before. It‚Äôs also the perfect time to buy calls because everyone is selling/will be selling around the 3rd due to the 30 day IPO hold to open the floodgates for IPO buyers to sell."
Eos Energy. Ticker symbol $EOSE
$TSLA puts have been fun this month
Congrats and f you - a June $TSLA put holder
$UNH after this üìàüìàüìà
"Selling calls on $UNH at this level is highly regarded, plus there were reports of government officials and insiders buying up tons of shares."
"You made this happen.  . I also triggered the $ASTS run by selling calls.  . But is this loss? you got the premium, I presume you chose a strike price above your avg too"
$UNH pumping lol
No need to feel sorry for him - In his other account he made $200K on $HOOD calls
I love $RDDT. In it for the long haul!!
"Oh nice! I sold my $HOOD calls at open yesterday for a small profit. I didn't check how they did after that, I assume I sold at the top."
SPY 0DTE‚Äôs and $GOOGL calls I held over the weekend
$GOOGL better open like it just found $AGI or I'm eating ramen seasoned with tears¬†
". Looking for a nice $BTC bounce tonight. . Edit:. Held for a few minutes after open because I didn't get a great fill and the price dropped immediately. $BTC holding steady, so I risked the hold. Ended up with a nice little $12K win. Looks like my trading day is done. Back to bed. . "
$17K $MSTR YOLO
Not a bet I would take but not a far fetched bet. $BTC bounces like a yoyo.
$BTC to ~$97
I posted about my all in $MSTR yesterday. Lost 30k and got paper hands. Will make it all back with $NVDA and $AAPL 
Screw $MSTR. All in $AAPL and $NVDA short term calls
"And now, as is the law of the universe, $MSTR will moon"
Now my $MSTR calls can print
My $MSTR calls got bent over and probed today.

"A regarded boy asks his father, ‚ÄûDad, can I borrow 350 dollars to buy one $TSLA share?‚Äù  . The father replies, ‚Äû350 dollars? What do you need 300 dollars for?

"How to buy Calls on Ketamine in the Austin, $TX area?"
"$TSLA baggies should remember that, once again, Elon did this to himself.  And you, he also did this to you ü´µüò≥"

When you short $TSLA on the delivery consensus being too high but Elon and Don get into a fight a day before the release.... *Chefs kiss*
All you gotta do is wait for $CRCL to bounce upwards so they trap some people then load poots
ü•≠ is gonna make sure $TSLA has a bad time
"Yesterday this thread was completely bullish on Googl, and then it dumped. Now there is a $TSLA dump euphoria, this tells me it's about V for no reason"
I should have bought $HOOD not $GOOGL FUCK FUCK.
Big executive exits $TSLA. ‚ÄúMusk will now oversee everything he did‚Äù as if he doesn‚Äôt already have an infinite amount of work he should be doing. Just proof that these execs do literally nothing other than present other people‚Äôs work to a board and jerk off.
"Got in and out of $TSLA, fuck holding this shit"
The longer $UNH CEO is not killed the more the stock goes up..
‚ÄúAre you gonna deport Elon Musk‚Äù. ‚Äú We‚Äôll have to take a look‚Äù. $TSLA 500 EOW
$TSLA bulls are coping hard after Elon messed with both Democrats and Republicans and is about to go even more nuts if the BBB is passed. How can you even be a $TSLA bull at this point?
$TSLA BLOOD RED
$HOOD rising on the news that 19% of adult Americans fail basic reading tests
My $TSLA calls are musked
$GOOGL the most piece of shit stock ive ever held.
What the fuck is $TSLA going to close green today and $GOOGL red
My 856 shares on $UNH finally paying off.. If you sold out without waiting for earnings you are a regard
Why would anyone buy $TSLA right now before their dogshit delivery numbers tomorrow
Daily grinding for $200. Losing $2000 the same day with $ACHR calls. That's the game
Retards rotating from $TSLA to BULL
$TSLA 270 today queen?
$GOOGL tested 180 like bers test company from the opposite sex. not for them. back to being gae
$AMD went back to its *Advanced Money Distroyer* status?. **Lisa pls save us** üò´
"Meta ripped up on the news that they have been poaching OpenAI engineers. $AAPL rips up on the news that they are finally halfway there in the AI game. Meanwhile, $GOOGL"
"No matter how memey a stock is.. \- Alienating all of your domestic and international customers  . \- Offering a worse product than competitors  . \- Relying on fat government contracts to save your company  . \- Falling out with the God-king head of the government and threaten to start your own rival political party.. Is not a good idea.. $TSLA has to be doomed. There's a lot of big money balls-deep in their stonks who have a vested interest in not allowing it to fall too far since the house of cards will wreck them, but there's not a single income stream Musky hasn't fucked up. Sooner or later the big players are gonna decide they want to be the 1st to get the fuck out."
$HOOD 120c
Elon selling $TSLA shares again
"$TSLA calls entered, waiting for fraud green candle"
if not for $AAPL we'd be down -.50% already
I love how ppl come in here after the fact and say ‚Äúcalls on $XYZ was free money‚Äù ‚Ä¶ the fuck was that claim before open?
$UNH is something what we waited guys i hope you bought
"bought $HOOD calls at 97, DOWN 10K F\*\*\*"
$GOOGL is fucking dogshit
What if $GOOGL went up instead of down. That‚Äôd be wild.
10 million people losing access to Healthcare is good how? $UNH calls??
there is a generational dump and rally on $TSLA every other week LMAO
It‚Äôs actually insane that $MSTR is worth $100 billion. That‚Äôll be in textbooks some day lmao
"But I thought $AMD was a value stock.. Sigh.. Soon as I go bals deep on $AMD, $GOOGL, and $PLTR they respectfully eat shit :)"
am i broke or is $MCD expensive now
I converted the entirety of my Roth IRA to $HOOD LEAPS a couple weeks ago
I will admit I never expected $HOOD to climb this much from $7
Awesome!. (I did that with $MSTR and $ASTS. It also was awesome.)
"Those are BOTH ITM ‚Ä¶ Close em, take the profit & either re-open other $HOOD LEAPS w higher strikes (same or dif expiration) or move the profits into a different play."
"Just showed this to my wife, now she wants a divorce and to go all-in on $HOOD LEAPS too."
$BULL is next!!

"only 9.38% portfolio diversity? Use your other 90% and buy more $HOOD.. anyways, congratz and fuck u"
"I can't believe I bought $HOOD puts today. Not my proudest move, I'm such an idiot."
Do you draw key levels and use $GXXM to supplement your outlook at all? Or is this pure vibes based¬†
Bought 30x $20 $HOOD calls in 2023. Sold them in 2024 and put all the proceeds towards shares. Been holding ever since. $HOOD is a super long term hold IMO. 
$HOOD buy and hold since last April
"I dug into the rabbit hole of Palantir and Alex Karp last night and came to the conclusion that they essentially are fast forwarding our timeline to that of the ‚ÄúMinority Report‚Äù. Eventually Palantir‚Äôs software will be able to predict crime before it even happens and with their partnership with $BBAI I‚Äôm bullish. $BBAI is in Airports, UAE, Defense Tech, Space Cybersecurity and more. . I‚Äôm YOLOing 20+k into 388 contracts.. "
$BBAI YOLO CALLS
"Funny story: a week ago a friend asked for stocks I thought would gain 50% this year.  I gave him a list of 10 including $BBAI.  I just texted him back the other day saying ""We got there in a week!!!"""
We back back boys!!! $HODL. 
$BULL
"I'm buying BULL at least until it's half of $HOOD MC. WeBull is the far superior product, they just rolled crypto out for first time to Brazil and more countries to come in coming months."
I wish all the $BULL holders gains but holy fuck have any of the holders ever used the platform?
$BULL LETSGOWWW üî•üî•üî•üî•
God i hate when people say $HODL on stocks I own
Kramer said dont touch $BULL so I immediately bought.
LFG bulls on $BULL
$CRWV 9K  My Contrarian Move
Grats. Being bearish on $CRWV isn't contrarian.  A contrarian move on $CRWV would be buying way OTM calls.
$SOFI Gains (+$152k)
Fucking a congrats. I sold all my $SOFI around $14. Rode that crap for a long time from $14 to $5 and back to $14
Percentage gains only please. I‚Äôm up 115? On C and $IBM too.¬†
I was up like 9k with $HOOD. Greed got the best of me. I thought it would hit üíØ. Ended up cashing with 4.4k profits. I hope you all made your money on today‚Äôs market.
$HOOD just keeps going upüòÆ‚Äçüí®üöÄü¶Ö
"$HOOD coin, momentum"
$IREN Play Gain
"nice, I have a bunch of Jan 2027 30C. I'm up a little more than 100% right now. Planning on rolling up when newer strikes open with good liquidity until $IREN hits my target of 60-100. This one will probably be a slow burn until big money notices this stock and they prove themselves with their new centers"
$CVNA buys and sells your debt.
TLDR;. $CVNA uses private companies linked to its board members to boost its books and can afford to do so due to said insiders selling massive amounts of shares making it worth their while. . Having trouble offloading vehicles? Sell to fraudster Daddy Garcia's used car company for dollars on the dime.. Having trouble offloading debt? Sell to board member's company who will mark it as less risky?. Someone defaulting? Give them an extension and keep it on the books as future profit until we all dump our stock at the top and sell covered calls on the rest before the stock tanks from 400 million dollars in insider selling in < 1 month.
"$CVNA has rallied¬†**>1000% from 2022 lows**, despite high debt and opaque financial engineering. This is classic¬†**meme-stock energy**"
Me losing money on $GOOGL at a sub-20 PE while this shit happens all the time with absolute shit companies that probably won't even exist in 10 years. (:
They took the auto loan and turned it into the synthetic CDO. They‚Äôre no shares available to short through $IBKR. Someone is pumping it up on low vol.
Institutions. Movement on $CVNA is weird
"Liquidity and easy financing, people are addicted to cars. . The used market is red hot because ALL new cars are luxury items now,  and they cost a premium to purchase and a premium to insure. . Not unlike the subprime mortgage meltdown, Carvana will remain red hot until there's a liquidity crisis and defaults begin piling up, repos, etc. . Also, people simply buy everything online. Carvana is the eBay or $AMZN of cars."
I‚Äôm shorting $CVNA and it has been rather painful experience.
"Look no one cares about the borderline fraud looking financials, allegedly. Americans don‚Äôt like the car buying process and this alone is why $CVNA will keep climbing until the economy blows up."
[BREAKING] $AAPL Weighs Using Anthropic or OpenAI to Power Siri in Major Reversal
"You know for a company with more free cash than God himself, $AAPL does a remarkably poor job of deploying it in R&D."
12 mins before the Bloomberg article dropped a huge 600k/min volume enter $AAPL. Wish I was this cool to know before shiz hits public.
You know $AAPL dropped the ball when they are considering going with MSFT's OpenAI for their LLM solutions lol
All roads lead to $NVDA
This is such a dumb move for $AAPL. Goes to show you how hard it is to innovate when you‚Äôre a large company.
Siri has been horrible‚Ä¶ $AAPL needs Openai or Anthropic to save them
W for $GOOGL too if they deepen their partnership with OpenAI
This is what happens when you're too greedy and don't wanna spend your $100B cash on those precious $NVDA GPUs!!
Siri is the worst AI in existence and it belongs to $AAPL. Hopefully they can do meaningful updates.
$AAPL is such a mess
the thought of taking inference compute from developers to allow $AAPL users to generate their shitty memoji‚Äôs is not the timeline i want o live on¬†
"My moneys on Anthropic.  $AAPL will wanna stay in the ‚ÄúA‚Äùs, and Microsoft is wrapped up with OpenAI so they would potentially create some conflicts I bet. Deep in a filing cabinet of partner policies somewhere."
All in $MSTR calls. 100% of my account. Zero? Or a million?
"There will probably be more ‚Äúbudget neutral‚Äù announcements for the federal government purchasing bitcoin by then, so why not. At this point though I would probably just buy options on $IBIT. Since Saylor has no chill"
Godspeed dude you might make it cuz $BTC gonna pump
"Considering everyone who owns $BTC is bullish on $BTC right now, zero. Sorry bud I don‚Äôt make the rules."
Million. Savor the tears when $MSTR hits $1T marketcap
"Not that the long-term prospects of $MSTR matters for the timeline OP is operating on, but I thought this was an interesting exchange on Odd Lots this morning:. [. **Weisenthal:** ""Now, so who's actually buying micro strategy because you know, I thought once the spot ETFs, the spot bitcoin ETFs came out, like this business model will go away, and it hasn't."". **Chanos:** ""No, because there's a wonderful sales job that's being done about the fact that this is an economic engine in and of itself, and so therefore terms like ""Bitcoin yield"" are used, and they've called them financial gibberish because they are, and in fact this will get arbitraged away ultimately by companies that will do this to try to capture that spread.   . In the case of Micro Strategy is substantial. It's still fifty billion dollars something like that of the difference between the value of the enterprise value of the company and the value of their bitcoin holdings.   . But the thing that really kind of shot me into orbit on all this was when a Saylor and others then said, well, no, you can't really value us on an NAV basis and so called m NAB multiple of NAV. You actually have to also give us additional value for the amount of profit that we make every quarter from the appreciation in the asset. . And I just pointed out, I said, well, **that's like saying, you know, my whole net worth is in a house that's worth four hundred thousand dollars that is now worth five hundred thousand dollars a year or two later, And my net worth is not five hundred thousand dollars now, it's two and a half million, because it's the value of the house plus a multiple on the increase in the profitability the asset.**"""
I can't wait to revisit this. I 1/4 of my sons stocks in $STRK lol
At least Im not the only retard whose all in with $MSTR
I bought $MSTR calls last week that have since gone 2x. Bought about 15k worth. Still holding.
last time i full ported into $MSTR i lost it all in a matter of a class period. . godspeed regard
Bro shoulda gone for $CLBR
Should‚Äôve put them on $MARA
How‚Äôd you set $IBKR to show positions on the Dynamic Island?
Why $MSTR
SP 500 qualification will be met today as long as bitcoin closes over 95k at 8pm EST. Huge earnings coming up. $MSTR is the stock of the decade to get into. Bitcoin going to rally these next 5-7 years. They have preferreds out now. Multi trillion dollar market cap incoming. Ppl are sleeping on $MSTR.
"Why is everyone shitting on this? $MSTR has all the potential it needs to pump hard in July. It doesn't matter if it gets into S&P or not. Or if earnings will be good or not.. Just go all-in calls right now and the rumors, earnings runup and bitcoin making potential new ATHs will take care of the rest. Get out before the actual news arrives. It's a buy the rumor sell the news kinda thing.. Disclaimer: I'm all in on August 1 calls, please help my bags."
"You can tell everybody in this sub is broke and retarded because they don‚Äôt see the potential in this play. $MSTR is primed for a breakout into the 1000s, 6 month consolidation and a bull flag on bitcoin. . This guy will be rich and you‚Äôll still be broke trying to figure out how everyone gets more lucky than you. It‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt see the potential in this play, these will print OP. To everyone who thinks this play is dumb, stop trading and start buying the SP500. $MSTR is an infinite money glitch that‚Äôs currently extremely undervalued."
135 shares of $TSLA
"I've bought one cheap put yesterday afternoon, when I saw $TSLA stopped responding to the two green days (before the Musk tweets). What makes you think it will just start going up? Even in case he stops that social media crap, why would the price go higher, than it was before he (re)started it?"
Still all in on $FUBO
$HOOD RICH?
Do you think $HOOD has more room to moon?
Im in a $BULL train
"Busted through 100k today. $HOOD is such a monster ‚Äî revolutionizing the game. First gain post, screenshot means sell apparently. I think I‚Äôm good ü´° $RDDT is next "
Thank you $HOOD
Announced Robinhood Chain but the anti-crypto bros will still tell you it‚Äôs a scam while investing 5 figs into it. . TOO BAD YOURE A $CRCW BRO TOO NOW
Had $HOOD at 18 and sold at 25 for some nice gains‚Ä¶.
I have 800 shares of $HOOD too! $100 soon and $150+ by eoy (they will get in S&P 500 in September)
$HOOD haters been quiet lately and especially today!!! It absolutely obliterated shorts today lmao. They're firing on all cylinders and still have more coming and coming FAST! Cant deny their place in the market now.
"$HOOD got my portfolio to 20,000 today. Thanks vlad"
Y'all really making me nervous with my shares supporting $HOOD now
Thanks I‚Äôll make sure to buy $MSTR and $IONQ-WT puts
bro you're supposed to sell put on $MSTR not buy calls
Buy $BULL and taste what winning is
Heavy betting on $IONQ-WT is crazyy
Did you believe what some specialists say here on Reddit about $IONQ-WT tanking just because the ceo sold some stock worth a few millions xD. Sorry but that was such an obvious mistake. I bought calls the second I saw the third post about how ionq will tank because of that
$CORZ calls?
$HOOD tokenizing the world. $150 soon.
