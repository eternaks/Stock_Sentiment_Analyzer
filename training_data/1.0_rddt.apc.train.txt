Today I did the financial equivalent of freebasing AI hype and slapping the buy button like it wronged myancestors. 500contracts. $T$150C. Expiring nextFriday. Because nothing says‚Äúemotionalstability‚Äù like lighting $27K on fire for a company that sounds like a crypto rug pull dressed in a Patagoniavest.. Do I have aplan? Sortof. The plan is Wall Street suddenly remembers CoreWeave is the unofficial dealer for every AI junkie in SiliconValley. The plan is that Nvidia wakes up feeling flirty and drags the entire sector withit. The plan is that something literally anything sends this stock full anime power up mode and rips it $20+ by nextFriday.That‚Äôs theplan. Is itgood? Absolutelynot. Butit‚Äôsmine.. Mythesis?It‚ÄôsAI.It‚Äôshot.It‚Äôsunderloved.It‚Äôsdue. If $NVDA can hit $1400 off vibes and a Midjourneyslideshow, then CoreWeave can absolutely rip on pure speculation andcaffeine.. If ithits? I walk into a SoftBank yacht party like I belong there and soft launch myfund: Delusional VibeCapital.. If itdoesn‚Äôt? I explain to my mom why her retirement is now tied up in something that sounds like a League of Legendschampion.. My entire investment strategy is basically‚Äútrust thevibes, ignore theGreeks.‚Äù.I‚Äôm not just long on$CRWV.I‚Äôm long ondelusion..

Craziest thing is that the economy has been a zombie for 2+ years now but none of this matters to themarkets.

Hi,.i'll keep it short andsweet. $T$ is my bet for upcoming tech earningsseason. For the belowreasons.\- company has been overspending onM&A which was a big mistake for a growth company that needs to have sustainable organic growthfirst. Now the company has finally shifted to focus on profitability and stopped its spendingspree.\- They have acquired some valuablebusinesses/segments however the synergies areinclear. I am betting that they will give more clarity upcoming earningscall.\- Stock has flatlined since April 2nd Tariff BoardDebacle, however $ MSFT $NOW and $SNOW have recoverednicely. $CRM looks like the $GOOGL/ black sheep of the bunch but this all might turnsoon..\- Word on the street isAGENTFORCE, this is their racehorse that is supposed to make up for all the legacy software that they have been selling in thepast. I believe this is a gamechanger for $CRM because of the populairdemand. They have finally found their place in thea.i.revolution..Downsides.\- Company has been spending like crazy and fumble the bag on earningscalls. They could not reassure analysts that they know they will make a profit in the future from all theseacquistions.\- I am getting $GOOGL vibes from this company meaning that we all know it has potential but itdoesn't get the same love from itspeers..[Positiondetails](.

For some reason I actually believe thatthey'll do well in theshort-run as the AI hype train moveson.. They have a strong in with the large group of US companies who do not know what they are doing when it comes to tech but wants to feel modern at a"decentprice".They'll pump renewals and upgrades using the AI hype and then upsellagain.. Butit'll all come falling down when ROI never materializes and the squeeze comes for the minnows and regionalmidmarket..(But their products are slop andI'd neverrecommend/use/encourage anyone to usethem.

I'll start bysaying,I've been following this company for quite sometime. I wrote this DD last night and unfortunately did not get to posting it intime.(kms). Youdon't have to believe me it isokay.**My thesis and everything I am about to say still remainstrue.**. Up109.56% in the lastyear, $T$ Materials($MP), is a fantasticinvestment. At a price per share of$30.03, this is an absolutesteal.Let‚Äôs get into why I believeso.**Edit:(Now at a price of$45.23)**.**Overview-** The company operates in the Rare Earth Element(REE) miningindustry. A key part of this thesis is that they are UNITED STATESbased. As a matter offact, they are the onlyU.S. producer and supplier ofREE‚Äôs. They fully own and operate MountainPass, which is a rare earth mine in SanBernardino,California. This mine has been around for quite sometime, first being used in1952. Throughout the60‚Äôs and80‚Äôs, Mountain Pass was theworld‚Äôs dominant $REEsupplier, producing over70% of globalREE‚Äôs at itspeak. The most abundant ore in the mine is calledBastnasite, which is one of the three primary earthminerals. This ore contains6%-8% of Total Rare Earth Oxide(TREO) which is considered exceptionally high by globalstandards. Most deposits contain1%-4%$TREO. $TREO is a standard measurement used in the $REE mining industry to express $REE content inore..**Production-** Now listenup. In April of2022, the company announced plans to build a250,000 sqft plant in FortWorth, Texas which it calls‚ÄúThe IndependenceFacility‚Äù. This plant is the first fully integrated rare earthmetal,alloy, and magnet manufacturing plant in the UnitedStates. The building has since beencompleted. In early2025, the facility began commercial production of NdPrmetal, and trial production ofautomotive-grade sinteredneodymium-iron-boron(NdFeB)magnets. This marks a significant achievement for thecompany, and for theU.S. supply chain as awhole. The trial production of NdFeB magnets is set to switch to commercial production towards the end of2025. This facility will have the ability to produce magnet supply for500,000EV‚Äôs everyyear, and they are already partnered with $GM forthis. $MP Materials magnets will be in the HUMMEREV, CadillacLYRIQ, Chevrolet SilveradoEV, and more than a dozen othermodels.**The news of their magnets going into commercial production will be the next large catalyst for thestock.**.**What isNdPr?**Neodymium-Praseodymium is a rare earth alloy that is critical in the production ofhigh-powered magnets which are NdFeBmagnets. Neodymium provides magnetic strength while Praseodymium provides corrosion and heatresistance..**Why are NdFeB magnetsimportant?** They are a critical part of the modern world and supplychain. Demand in recent years has been skyrocketing as the continued shift towards clean energycontinues. There are endless applications for thesemagnets, some of whichinclude: Use in electric vehiclemotors, windturbines,smartphones,laptops, missile guidancesystems,drones,radars, fighterjets, MRImachines, andmore. In a report by theS&P Global MarketIntelligence, the use of NdFeB magnets in electric vehicles is expected to be the biggest driver ofdemand, which is predicted to increase from7.1% of all $REE demandnow, to23.8% by2040. The main component of these magnets is Iron at about65%-70%, while NdPr makes up28%-32%..**Understanding the Supply Chain-** Now that we have established thebasics, the main thesis lies in the global supplychain. Fordecades, China has dominated both $REE production andsupply. This means they have nearly full control overNdPr, andtherefore, they also control production of the highly demanded NdFeBmagnets. Mining theseREE‚Äôs is not as simple as taking it out of theground. The mined ore needs to be processed which means it gets sent to China because they dominate the refinement processtoo‚Ä¶ In the words of Chinese leader DengXiaoping,‚ÄúThe Middle East hasoil. China has rareearths.‚ÄùHowever, in recentyears, theU.S. and other countries likeAustralia, have opened their eyes and realized they need their own domesticproduction. In2024, the United States produced45,000 tonnes ofREO‚Äôs(Rare EarthOxides). That represents6.9% of theworld‚Äôs total production for theyear. China on the otherhand, produced270,000 tonnes ofROE‚Äôs, representing69% of worldproduction. So not only does China produce the most significant amount ofREO‚Äôs, but they also process and refine a whopping90% of theworld‚ÄôsREE‚Äôs. Their ability to do so comes from decades ofinvestment, focused on building a vertically integrated supplychain.. It is a matter of national defense that theU.S. gets NdFeBmagnets. Since2020, the DOD has awarded more than $439 million to establish domestic $REE supplychains. Their main focus being to create a‚Äúmine-to-magnet‚Äùprocess. That is exactly what the company $MP Materials is focused onbecoming. Asmentioned, in the latter half of2025, they are expecting to be commercially producing NdFeBmagnets. They will be the ONLY United States company capable of miningREE‚Äôs and processing them into NdFeBmagnets. That is not to say there are not other magnet producers in theU.S, just none quite like $MPMaterials.. This business strategy is already payingoff. NdPr oxide and metal revenue for the first quarter of 2025 was$24.32million, compared to$8.33 million in the previous firstquarter. That is a192%increase. Their NdPr production rose330% in the sameperiod, with sales of NdPr increasing by246%.**When looking at things like their incomestatement, nothing is going to wowyou. This is not a company having record breaking years by anymeans.** That is why we must understand the bigger picture and the need for domestic $REEproduction..**RECENTNEWS: July10****^(th)****,2025.** $MP Materials just secured $1 billion in funding from JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs to build its secondU.S. magnet manufacturingplant, which is called the‚Äú10xfacility‚Äù because it is set to 10x theirproduction. This facility is set to be completed in2028. On top ofthis, the Department of Defense purchased $400 million worth ofstock, making them the largest shareholder in the company at15%. The DoD is also issuing a $150 million loan to support $MP Materials expansion of their heavyrare-earth separation at MountainPass.. This deal sent the priceflying! I suspect it will come back down for a nice buyingopportunity.However, I think anything under $100 with this stock is a greatdeal.

Ifyou've been on WSB for any time atall,you've read a new DD andthought,"This guy is amoron; his play will neverwork"‚Äîonly to check the ticker a couple weeks later and seeit's already up over100%. This is your chance to right that wrong and make a shit ton of money in theprocess..**SKIP THIS PART IFRETARDED:**. Thanks to $NVDA andCo, computer chips are faster thanever. Theproblem? Electronic data transmissioncan't keepup. Because ofthermodynamics, the fastest that data can effectively be electronically transmitted at the chip level is around100Gbps-ish. In order to maximize the power of those $NVDA chips companies pay millionsfor,they'll HAVE TO switch to photonics(data transmission usinglight).Okay, so who is making thistechnology? A lot of companies(Broadcom,Mitsubishi,Foxconn,Lumentum,etc). The tricky part is converting between electronic data from the chips and photonic data from the transmissionmodules. This is where $T$ Technologies comes in(here is theirwebsite, if you want to try to better understand what theydo:[POET](. $POET is incrediblywell-positioned for the inevitable photonicsboom. Their partners includeFoxconn,Mitsubishi, CelestialAI,Luxshare,Adtran,Mentech, andLessengers. $POET will supply these companies with Optical Interposers that they will add to their OpticalModules. Those companies will sell those Optical Modules to AI datacenters, cloudcomputing,telecom,etc. Diagram for the mentallyimpaired:.Now, $POET is apre-revenuecompany.However, the switch from electronic to photonicchip-level data transmission is happening*as wespeak*. Andso, the single most important statement of this entireDD:**POET WILL START SHIPPING ORDERS TO THEIR $CUBB AND MAKING SIGNIFICANT REVENUE WITHIN THE NEXTMONTHS,WEEKS, ORDAYS.** The reason why thishasn't already started is because the customers in the final step of the diagram need to wait6-9 months totest-run the technology before finalizing their orders-- standard practice in the industry([Source]( In otherwords, the orders have ALREADY BEENPLACED, and everyone is simply waiting for the tests to conclude to actually start fulfillingthem:"Infact,\[Rep. from $POETcustomer\] stated that they already have a large hyperscaler customer who has placed orders for thesolution."[(](. With such a small marketcap, a skeptic might wonder how $POET would be able to defend their valuable position in theindustry.First, they have a shit ton of patents for their technology([Source](Additionally, their variouspartners/customers have incorporatedPOET's technology into a wide variety of transmissionspeeds:400Gbps,800Gbps,1.6Tbps, and even3.2Tbps. Rightnow,1.6T and3.2T are not needed in the vast majority ofcases.However, as companies require faster and faster data transmission in the comingyears,they'll still be buying optical modules withPOET's techinside. Because ofthis, I cannot reiterate enough howwell-positioned $POET is to capitalize on the AI/ data centerboom..**IFRETARDED, START READINGHERE:**. Knowing that $POET will start making moneyhand-over-fist in the nearfuture, the next step is to calculate how much they could actuallymake. Taken from their Q4 2024 earningsreport:."Established a majorwafer-level assembly and test facility for optical engines inPenang, Malaysia with the signing of several agreements with Globetronics ManufacturingSdn.Bhd., a leading semiconductor manufacturer andcontractor, equipping Globetronics with the capacity to manufacture an initial**1 million $POET optical enginesannually**."([Source](. Butthat's notall. They recently made another manufacturing agreement for even moreproduction, expected to be ready in 1 to 2quarters:."POET Technologies has signed a manufacturing agreement with NationGate Solutions in Malaysia to produce optical engineassemblies, enhancing its manufacturing capabilities and**addressing growing customerdemand**."([Source](. Because the Globetronics facility is already up and running([Source](I'll be conservative and use the production numbers from that facilityalone.Again, beingconservative,I'll average the 400G and 800G optical units at $250 apop. 1M units\* $250/ unit is$250M. Multiply that by aP/S ratio of10, and you get a market cap of$2.5B-- representing a**5X** from the current market cap of$500M. And that revenue is going to start pouring in anyday. Butlet's get crazy and estimate what this could be 3 years in thefuture. $MMM units\* $500/ unit(accounting for1.6T,3.2T being moreexpensive)\* 10P/S ratio = $15B market cap--**30Xupside** from current shareprice.. The best part about thissituation? Wall Streetdoesn't care enough aboutpre-revenue microcaps to understandPOET'spotential. Once institutions take the time to understandPOET's position in a rapidly burgeoningindustry, this thing will practically double overnight(Andyes, I know thatit's already up over50% from the recentlows. I posted this as soon as this got above the $500M mkt caprequirement).. If this stock gets ANY sort of publicattention, the market will quicklyre-price itsvaluation. Coupled with the incoming slew of positive news(fulfilled purchaseorders,revenue, newproducts,etc), this has the potential to go on a crazyrun. The only caveat is that Ican't tell you when exactly this couldhappen.POET's CEO has reiterated that H2 2025 will bring revenue--I'd guess orders start getting announced beforeSeptember. Thatdoesn't mean you should go and buy calls expiring in amonth,though.. The easiest way to play this is to buy shares and chill-- I am almost certain that $POET will at least double by the end of theyear. If you happen to be a degenerate gambler and are morally against buying shares-- go for1/16/26 or1/15/2710c. The options chain is stupidlybullish, and it could easily gammasqu\*eze if the share price continues to go up and degenerates continue buying OTMcalls.. My base case is$12/SHARE byEOY, and$30/SHARE by Q32026. My optimistic case is$30/SHARE byEOY, and$45-60/SHARE(3.75B to 5B mktcap) by Q32026. We could easily see $60 or higher sooner than that if you get hype and news at the righttime..**TL;DR**\--$POET, a $500M mkt cap photonicscompany, is on the cusp of generating significantrevenue. Think of the potential for an immediate 5Xreturn,minimum. The market is largely unaware of thisstock, and it will undergo a dramaticre-pricing in the coming weeks andmonths. Buy into the nextmulti-bagger BEFORE ithappens..**Position:**.EDIT: Initially forgot aboutthis, butthey've won a bunch of awards for theirtechnology.Doesn't really mean much for shareprice, butit's evidence that this whole thingisn'tvaporware..**2025 Lightwave‚ÄØAward‚Äì‚ÄúOutstanding AIHardware‚Äù**([Source](.**2025 AI Breakthrough Awards‚Äì‚ÄúAI Hardware InnovationAward‚Äù**([Source](.**2024 Global Tech Awards‚Äì‚ÄúBest in ArtificialIntelligence‚Äù**([Source](.**2024 Merit Awards‚Äì‚ÄúAI Innovator of theYear‚Äù**([Source](.**2024 AI Breakthrough Awards‚Äì‚ÄúBest Optical AISolution‚Äù**([Source](

Big expectations from theCEO, below is the newsletter sent to investors today...hence the18%jump?... The latter half of 2025 looks VERYinteresting...Thanks again to Steady Jerry for placing this on my radar üôè.(NFA or a solicitation to buy or sell astock). $POET Technologies Newsletter. LETTER FROM THE CHAIRMAN& CEO. DearFriends,. In Q2 of2025, $T$ executed on our decision to move our optical engine assembly and testing facilities out of China and intoMalaysia. We opened the doors to an8,000-square-foot space in Malaysia that holdsstate-of-the-art equipment and provides every tool necessary to produce 1 million $POET optical engines peryear. Those engines will drive the next generation of hardware devices for the AI and data centermarkets.. The manufacturing center in Penang asserts thecompany‚Äôs aggressive shift intocommercialization. We can scale up to meet the demand from our customers who are seeking to rapidly improve AI and data centerconnectivity.. Located inside ofGlobetronics‚Äô massivebuilding, the $POET production floor features 25 units of equipment and a growing team of exceptionalengineers. They work closely with our Asian headquarters in Singapore to bring scalablewafer-level innovation based on the $POET Optical Interposer‚Ñ¢ toreality. We also addedNationGate, the largest electronics manufacturing services provider inMalaysia, as an additional assembler of our external light sourceproducts.. Our publicly announced customers have already received samples of our optical engines and lightsources, and are evaluating how they integrate with their owndevices. As the second half of 2025begins, we expect purchase orders to arrive asend-user customers qualify ourpartners‚Äô opticalmodules. With two qualifiedsub-contractors inplace, we are in a good position to add additional manufacturing capacity to meet any further demand past the current level of 1 millionunits.. You can see a video of our manufacturing facility in actionhere.. Our products at thecutting-edge of the optoelectronics industry have received praise from our customers and industryobservers. We just received our second consecutive AI Breakthrough Awardswin, earning Best AI Hardware Innovation for $POETTeralight‚Ñ¢, our line of1.6Tultra-high performance opticalengines.. In less than threemonths, $POET transformed our production resources into a fullwafer-scaleoperation.Now, we are ready to launch the next stage of ourjourney. It will be the most exciting phaseyet. We have just successfully concluded our Annual General and Special Meeting and are ready to pursue a fortuitous next 12months.

This post is spoton, wellresearched. I concur with the bullishpossibility. It could go up faster and further thanthis. The AI frenzy is unlike anything we have ever seen in terms of rapid investment of hundreds ofbillions, and $T$ helps leverage these dollars with moreenergy-efficientconnections. Energy efficiency and speed are the product ofPOET'sdevices, andthey've done it in acost-effective, scalablemanner. This is a potential rocket for thesereasons. Beyond datacenters, there are further markets in fiber networks to homes andbusinesses, cellularnetworks, sensors and Lidar forvehicles; all can benefit from a tiny chip that converts electrical signals tophotonics. Theselower-cost markets could license the tech from$POET, a pure profitarrangement, while $POET concentrates on thehigh-margin data centermarkets. Potential rocketship.

Decentwrite-up, but this reads more like a hype piece than a soberDD.POET‚Äôs tech sounds legit*intheory*, and the photonics bottleneck is real‚Äînobody‚Äôs disputingthat. The problem is the massive gap between‚Äútestingphase‚Äù and‚Äúrecurringrevenue.‚ÄùPre-revenue companies are graveyards for investor capital*unless*there‚Äôs a proven ramp + real demand +execution..Yes, the partnerships are interesting(Foxconn,Mitsubishi,etc.), but"partnership" ‚â†revenue. Hyperscalers test dozens of components and only scale up ahandful. Until $T$ shows actual POs being fulfilled atscale, all these projections arespeculative..Also, slapping a 10xP/S multiple on apre-revenue microcap is optimistic at best and misleading atworst. Those valuations come*after* revenue is growing and margins are proven‚Äî notbefore. Rightnow, this is still a bet onmanagement,execution, and markettiming..TL;DR: Interestingcompany, and photonics is a realtailwind, butdon‚Äôt confuse a good story with a goodinvestment.

Waited to have a post about this stock as it has just come out of penny status and now has a 1b+ market cap as ofyesterday.. Ifyou‚Äôve been sleeping on $T$ at~$2.10,($2.20 inpremarket), wakeup.. Northern Dynasty is deep in settlement talks with the EPA to reverse the 2023 veto on theworld-class Pebblecopper-gold-moly project inAlaska, with a joint status report due July17,2025. CEO Ron Thiessen calls these negotiations‚Äúthe fastest pathforward‚Äù for withdrawing the veto and getting the Army Corps back topermitting, which would instantly unlock one of the largest undeveloped copper deposits on theplanet..Pebble‚Äôs last resource estimate(Dec2017) clocks in at6.46 B tonnes grading0.40% Cu for56.9 bln lbs ofcopper, plus70.6 mozgold,3.4 bln lbs moly and 344 mozsilver. With a market cap of just ~1billion, that works out to an EV of only roughly$0.016 per pound of contained copper‚Äì versus the$0.16/lb average paid in recentM&A for similarassets.. Macro tailwinds areenormous. Forexample, PresidentTrump‚Äôs50% tariff on copper imports kicks in August1,2025, explicitly to‚Äúrevitalize the domestic copperindustry‚Äù and strengthen nationalsecurity..**Key upcoming dates to be awareof**. July17, 2025 EPA statusreport, if they greenlight additionalinfo, the intention for veto withdrawal could followfast. August1, 202550% copper tariff goes live. And in the unlikely event that the settlementfalters, Northern Dynasty and Alaska will pushappeals. Alaska even petitioned SCOTUS in July 2023 to overturn the veto(direct bid was denied Jan8,2024) but canre-route through lower courts and back to the Supreme Courtlater, inevitably in my opinion the Supreme Court will overturn the veto but this would take many years to playout.. The bear case is they have filed for an offering for a total of $75million, currently they have a good amount of cash on hand from selling royalties ongold/silver production and I suspect they will want to raise money on a big pump following intention to withdraw veto to fund initial assessments and put themselves in a better position to negotiate with a larger mining player to finance development in exchange for sharing theprofits..

I put money into RH ~5 yearsago. This was my‚Äòplay‚Äô money account and never considered it my‚Äòserious‚Äômoney.. Through various lifeevents, things got more and less stressful with thisaccount. It was especially stressful after the account reached ~100k inJan/Feb 2024 and I was locked into $T$calls. I cashed out and saw those calls become worth over800k.. it was very stressful thinking about thewoulda/coulda/shoulda. Sonaturally, I chased it just to piss nearly all that 100k away throughout 2024 on various‚Äògambles‚Äô because I thought I knew itall.. Long storyshort. Everyone was hating on Boeing(many people stilldo). I saw anopportunity. I started investing in longcalls.It‚Äôs not particularly‚Äòfun‚Äô to invest in a blue chip stock long calls like you crazy0DTE‚Äôersdo, but I consider it a great Americancompany. And there are tax benefits to long term vs short term gains(capital gainstax).. I can easily see Boeing going(much)higher, and I hope itdoes! Butit‚Äôs not worth the stress at this point in mylife. MaybeI‚Äôll buyshares, but mostly shifting most of this money into long term boglehead moves(boring). I did leave a couple bets on the tablethough..TLDR:don‚Äôt gamble with moneyyou‚Äôre not willing tolose. Know when to callit, win orlose. Good luck

$GOOGL

Here yougo:. OpenAI is close to releasing anAI-powered web browser that will challengeAlphabet's(GOOGL.O), opens new tabmarket-dominating $T$Chrome, three people familiar with the matter toldReuters.. The browser is slated to launch in the comingweeks, three of the peoplesaid, and aims to use artificial intelligence to fundamentally change how consumers browse theweb. It will give OpenAI more direct access to a cornerstone ofGoogle'ssuccess.. If adopted by the 400 million weekly active users ofChatGPT,OpenAI's browser could put pressure on a key component of rivalGoogle'sad-moneyspigot. Chrome is an important pillar ofAlphabet's adbusiness, which makes up nearlythree-quarters of itsrevenue, as Chrome provides user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively andprofitably, and also gives $GOOGL a way to route search traffic to its own engine bydefault..OpenAI's browser is designed to keep some user interactions within aChatGPT-like native chat interface instead of clicking through towebsites, two of the sourcessaid.. The browser is part of a broader strategy by OpenAI to weave its services across the personal and work lives ofconsumers, one of the sourcessaid.. OpenAI declined tocomment.. The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak publicly on thematter.. Led by entrepreneur SamAltman, OpenAI upended the tech industry with the launch of its AI chatbot ChatGPT in late2022. After its initialsuccess, OpenAI has faced stiff competition from rivals including $GOOGL and startupAnthropic, and is looking for new areas ofgrowth.. InMay, OpenAI said it would enter the hardwaredomain, paying$6.5 billion to buyio, an AI devices startup fromApple's(AAPL.O), opens new tab former designchief, JonyIve.. A web browser would allow OpenAI to directly integrate its AI agent products such as Operator into the browsingexperience, enabling the browser to carry out tasks on behalf of theuser, the peoplesaid.. Thebrowser's access to auser‚Äôs web activity would make it the ideal platform for AI"agents" that can take actions on theirbehalf, like booking reservations or filling outforms, directly within the websites theyuse.. TOUGHCOMPETITION. OpenAI has its work cut out- $GOOGLChrome, which is used by more than 3 billionpeople, currently holds more thantwo-thirds of the worldwide browsermarket, according to web analytics firmStatCounter.Apple's(AAPL.O), opens new tabsecond-place Safari lags far behind with a16%share. Lastmonth, OpenAI said it had 3 million paying business users forChatGPT.. Other AI startups like The Browser Company and Brave have announcedAI-powered browsers capable of performing actions on auser's behalf thisyear.Perplexity, awell-funded startup known for its searchengine, also launched its AIbrowser,Comet, onWednesday..Chrome's role in providing user information to help Alphabet target ads more effectively and profitably has proven so successful that the Department of Justice has demanded its divestiture after aU.S. judge last year ruled that the $GOOGL parent holds an unlawful monopoly in onlinesearch..OpenAI's browser is built atopChromium,Google's ownopen-source browsercode, two of the sourcessaid. Chromium is the source code for $GOOGLChrome, as well as many competing browsers includingMicrosoft's(MSFT.O), opens new tab Edge and Opera(OPRA.O), opens newtab.. Lastyear, OpenAI hired two longtime $GOOGL vice presidents who were part of the original team that developed $GOOGLChrome. The Information was first to report their hires and that OpenAI previously considered building abrowser.. An OpenAI executive testified in April that the company would be interested in buying Chrome if antitrust enforcers succeeded in forcing thesale.. $GOOGL has not offered Chrome forsale. The company has said it plans to appeal the ruling that it holds amonopoly.. OpenAI decided to build its ownbrowser, rather than simply a"plug-in" on top of anothercompany'sbrowser, in order to have more control over the data it cancollect, one sourcesaid.

Take the same app they have and add a browser seemlessly and they could changethings. But it needs to be $T$ levels of seemless and they need to talk with computer companies about being the new preinstalled default browser for businessreasons.. ChatGPT use is reallyhigh. If they implement the browser well enough then peoplewon't evennotice.

If you are convinced why not sell some naked puts on $T$ around $250 to finance thetrade? Surely a bit riskier but the cash from the puts could reduce your cost tozero. A move to $400 would be very profitable if it happened thissummer.
$UNH
Negative
$T$ will probably keep cutting and cutting their workforce in order to improve short termearnings.. But remember that things are still generally negative for$UNH. Increased scrutiny over their billing practices = less revenue overtime. Poor reputation for denying services = lessgrowth. Lack of comprehensive specialty care& hospitals = less growthpotential; they will lose customers to systems that can provide the wholepackage. $EMR switch to epic = a short term decrease in quality and quantity ofservice, but will eventually improve in longrun.. The only plus side is that theydon‚Äôt ownhospitals, sothey‚Äôre not as effected by the medicaid cuts as theircompetitors.

Southeast Asian Super App like Uber and $AAPL Pay had a lil Vietnamesehyper-baby.. Currently the market leader in transport and deliveries and a growing payment service we can see big growth over the next fewyears.. I visited Vietnam in late last year and as soon as Ilanded, everyone told me this is the app toget. All thelocals, all theexpats, especially all the tourists get this app as soon as they land and they use it foreverything.Food,transport,payments, it is amassive, massiveapp. And looking at the tourism data over the past year earnings should bestrong.. In Q12025, the number of foreign visitors to Vietnam surged by approximately30%year-on-year, reaching more than 6 millionarrivals, the strongest quarterly performance todate.. This will directly affectGRAB‚Äôs bottomline. Earnings are due end of the month and we can see a huge stock surge if we get a surprise based of of the increased tourismmoney.

This is my third and final attempt at aDD. My first two got taken down by themods. Give me achance. We all now know that the Big Beautiful Bill BBB just gotpassed, and it brings big changes to how gambling losses aretaxed.. Beginning in2026, gamblers can only deduct90% of theirlosses, meaning even abreak-even or losing gambler could owetaxes!!!!!!. I personally believe this will tank professional gambling andit‚Äôs about to send gambling stocks(DKNG,$PENN,$MGM,$CZR, $T$etc.) into anosedive..‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. New Gambling TaxRule. Old Rule- You could fully offset gambling winnings with gamblinglosses. Win$100K, lose$100K? $0taxable.. New Rule- You can only deduct90% of gamblinglosses.. If you win $100K and then proceed to immediately Yolo it onto red and lose$100K.You‚Äôre still taxed as if you won$10K..‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî.Consequences. Many professional gamblers will step away from the sport along with many average people like us who win very little or evenlose..Yeah, this is fucked and Idon‚Äôt know why Idon‚Äôt see more people talking aboutit.. Sidenote: I still believe people will want to gamble to scratch thatitch. They will just end up doing it offshore using cryptos and or buying stock options like usdegens..
