I am all in on $T$ My view is that this is an overreaction as outlined by the $HIMS CEO on X(. This is still a company growing at more than100% per year at 40x forwardearnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across theboard, so Idon‚Äôt believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with $HIMS continuing to be a retailfavorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significantdiscount. Could it golower?Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quitegood..Disclaimer: Not financial advice. I am not a financialadvisor. Infact, I can barely advisemyself. This post is for entertainment purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation tobuy,sell, or hold anysecurities.

I want to invest in $T$ but I cant get past the Mass Compounding accusations fromNovo.. How do you feel about the claim of MassCompounding? If a drug is short supply the FDA allows pharmacies to compound a patient tailored dosage pharmaceutical currently underpatent. However the FDA already ruled that GLP 1 is no longer in short supply and all three GLP 1 receptor drugs are under Patent until2030..Pharmacy/Telehealth companies like BlueChew are able to compound Viagra(genericSildenfil) because the drug isgeneric, is a unique dosage and does not hold a New Drug patent with theFDA.

In no particularorder:.- Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely asell-the-news eventanyways..- Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff instocks. $T$ highly correlated to fake internetmoney..- TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting inSeptember. This is a huge precedent which now means $TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and reviewperiods. Waymo will continue to expand faster than$TSLA..- Attention now shifts to July 22earnings. Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entireworld. Analyst downgrades arecoming. $TSLA will likely lower full yearguidance..- I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 andbeyond. It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions ofdollars..- Elon is still popping off about one ofMango‚Äôs closest White Houseaides. The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is notinsignificant..-$7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of thisyear..- Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cutsfurther.

The Robotaxi thing seems like a very dangerouslaunch. Listening to Wallstreet Breakfastpodcast, analysts in the know were talking about how the latestself-driving tests are still revealing serious flaws in thesystems, like being unable to recognize things likeone-way signs and schoolbuses' extendable"stop"signs. One account even said it blew past a school bus and hit severalchild-sized dummies withoutstopping..
