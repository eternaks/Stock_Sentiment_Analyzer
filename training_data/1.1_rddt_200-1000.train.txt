Besideshope, you can also consider checking out an AI I found a couple of weeks ago calledEyeQuant. It seems pretty good so far‚Äî it tells you once a day after the close whichS&P 500 stocks are beginning anuptrend. Forexample, it signaled that $T$ started an uptrend on May13th, and since then $NVDA is up about18%. According to theAI, that trend is still inplace. If youregister, it also notifies you when the uptrendends. What I also like is that it shows the backtesting of each signal over the past 7years, so you can see how reliable it has been historically and decide foryourself. Theydon‚Äôt receive anymoney, they just provide theinformation.. If you want to check itout,here‚Äôs the link[www.quantsoft.cl/eyequant](. Wish youluck!

No theyaren‚Äôtstock.. But Robinhood did explain how they weredifferent, and perhaps OpenAI should ask ChatGPT to explain to their own management what this actually is and how it works and then maybe their panties would be so bunchedup.. Long storyshort: It works essentially just like any other broker handlesstocks.. When you buy shares of $T$ at yourbroker, youdon‚Äôt hold those physical shares in yourpocket, your broker holds them foryou. You have a contract where the broker pinky swears that the stock belongs to you and notthem, butreally‚Ä¶ youaren‚Äôt placing your hands on that stock certificate any timesoon, ifever.. With this new Robinhoodstuff,it‚Äôs just likethat, but with crypto addedin. Robinhood holds some OpenAI equity and is parsing out promissory notes via crypto coins that Robinhood associates withit. Not a hugedifference, just some technology and assetchanges. You still get to trade the asset the brokerage holds as ifit‚Äôsyours, butyou‚Äôre going it with crypto instead of code running on a Schwabserver.. Is it ascam? Idon‚Äôtknow, nobody outside Robinhoodknows. But on thesurface,it‚Äôs no more a scam than a traditional brokeris.

TL;DR: Companies are hiring AI agents and bots faster than they can keep track ofthem.

There are now 10x more bots than humans in someorgs.. SailPointdoesn‚Äôt sellAI. They governit..They're the middle manager for the access machines and peopleget..

Hellofriends,I'mback. Here is $T$ $UPWK and my explanation on why I bought $150K+ inshares.. Atfirst, you see what looks like¬†aCAT. It starts off with the twoears. Looks like a catright?.Wrong. This is the NINE TAILED FOXPattern, not just anycat. So as usual with the destruction of the hidden leafvillage, $UPWK had some rebuilding todo. A massive dump candle hits like Painhimself.. But what theydon‚Äôtsee‚Ä¶ is that the chart neededthis. Naruto HASARRIVED. You can see his hairline being formed in thechart. Whichmeans,Naruto/UPWK is about to have some serious plot armor in the upcoming weeks andmonths.. You know what comesnext. Naruto meetsTsunade. Theydidn't show this in the show butthere's a bouncy entrance and the Chakara MassageExperience. Everyone knowsthere's a happy ending to Naruto because of his plotarmor.. For that reason I believe Upwork will breakout $17+ and bought a decentamount. This is fully shown in the TA of the chart for anyone with a $PHD such asmyself.

TL;DR:**Redwire**(**RDW**) is basically a bunch of different space focused companies focused on the new spaceeconomy. It has fundamentally upgraded its business model by**acquiring profitable defense UAV(fkindrones) specialist EdgeAutonomy**. Combined with a recent strategic capital raise(approx. $260Mgross), $T$ is now poised for accelerated revenuegrowth, improved margins(cash flowpositive), and significantly deeper penetration into defense and internationalmarkets..# Redwire"2.0": The Merged Entity& StrategicDirection.***Redwire(RDW):** A diversified space infrastructure company providing critical technology(avionics,sensors,power,structures,in-space manufacturing‚Äì like theircutting-edge antenna capabilities from theirGolden, CO"GoldenDome"facility). Moonshot potential for biotech like printing organs in space or makingdrugs. Involved in lots of MARS and MOON**shit**. Makingrobotics, makingthrusters, solararrays,etc..***$6B+pipeline, $500M+ q1 2025bids**.**BEFORE** adding in EdgeAutonomy.***Edge Autonomy(NowRedwire's UAVDivision):** Aproven, profitable manufacturer ofhigh-performance tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicles(UAVs) with strong existing defense and international customerbases. Key metrics atacquisition:**\~$115M in 2023revenue**.* Both space and drone stocks tend to trade at 10xp/s. $RDW combined will be at about**5x**. And**EBIDTApositive**. Not too many space or drone stocks can saythat. On valuation alone this is a greatbuy. But really the company is just now unlocking its true potential as it emerges as one of the largestplayers..# Edge Acquisition& Recent $260MOffering. The acquisition of Edge Autonomyisn't just a revenueaddition;it's a strategic pivot towardshigher-margin defense and dronemarkets. The recent upsized offering(net proceeds intended for strategicgrowth, repayment of the Edge Autonomy sellernote, and partial repurchase of preferredstock) strengthens the balance sheet and reduces certain forms ofdilution..***DRONEPOWERHOUSE:** Edge Autonomy propels $RDW into a leading position in the tactical UAVspace, especially for US& alliednations. This offers acounter-narrative topre-revenue dronecompanies..* Think of this like merging with $AIRO except Edge Autonomy is VERYPROFITABLE.* Drones make sense for a spacestock. Think about Aerovironment making the mars copter dronethingy. Or all the other lil space robotbros..***DEFENSEINTEGRATION:** Strong synergies betweenRDW‚Äôsspace-basedintelligence,surveillance, and reconnaissance tech andEdge‚Äôs aerialplatforms. $RDW has reported**350million**(as of early 2024reports), a significant portion tied todefense.Edge's inclusion should amplifythis.**GOLDENDOMEEEE**.***Combined ability to sell to defensedepartments. Deeperrelationships, biggerwins. Dealing with 1 larger company is easier forGSA.**.***INTERNATIONALEXPANSION:** LeveragesEdge‚Äôs existing international sales channels for both UAVs andRedwire‚Äôs broader spaceportfolio..***BALANCE SHEETOPTIMIZATION:** The recent\~$260M offering(closed\~June18,2025) iscrucial. Use of proceedsincludes:.* Repayment of the seller note for Edge Autonomyacquisition..* Repurchase of a portion of convertible preferred stock(mitigating potential future common stock dilution from thoseinstruments)..* General corporate purposes and strategicgrowth..* This significantlyde-risks the balance sheet and provides firepower forgrowth, making the current valuationpost-offering an interesting entrypoint..# Financial outlook with 1 example line ofbusiness.**Valkyrie Hall Effect Thrusters‚Äì Future GrowthDriver:**.***Technology:**NASA-licensed,best-in-class H71M thrustertech, commercialized with PhaseFour..***Market:**High-demand for efficient satellitepropulsion..***Bull Case Revenue(from Q22026):**Est.\~$1M/unit,\~300units/yr capacity(PhaseFour), $RDW50% share->**Up to $150M additional annual revenue for$RDW.**.* This propels the2024-2026 bull case total revenue CAGR to an impressive\~23.0%, driven byhigh-margin, differentiatedtechnology..**OTHER LINES OFBUSINESS:**.* Continued leadership in coreareas: solararrays, deployablestructures,sensors,avionics, andin-spacemanufacturing..*Redwire's facility inGolden, Colorado(the"GoldenDome" site for thiscontext), is a center of excellence for advanced antenna and $RFAIRsystems, critical for both commercial and defense spaceapplications..**Here's some of what $RDW does besides theacquisition:**.**Big or Strategically Important Contract Wins(Examples):**.**Future Contracts& Opportunities Important toWin:**.***"GoldenDome" Project(U.S. MissileDefense):** Actively pursuing contracts for advancedspace-based missile defensesystems. Potentialmulti-billion-dollarprogram..***Next-Generation Uncrewed Systems forDoD:** With EdgeAutonomy,well-positioned for autonomousswarming,AI-drones, integratedairborne-spaceintel..***Commercial Space StationModules:** Contracts for modules(e.g., OrbitalReef, which $RDWsupports) forresearch,tourism, industrialuse..***Lunar Gateway& Deep SpaceHabitats:** Continued involvement inNASA's lunarGateway, developing tech for sustained human deep spacepresence..* Honestly the**manufacturing** and**biotech inspace** isawesome, and a great moonshot to mention with mooncontracts, space stationcontracts, goldendome, and marscontracts..***Internationalcontracts** from other countries space programs and privateventures..***RANDOM SHIT($6Bpipeline)**.**Acquisition of Made In Space&In-Space ManufacturingHighlights:**.***Made In Space(MIS)Acquisition:** Pioneer inon-orbit spacemanufacturing, developed first commercial $DDD printer onISS..***ISS Additive Manufacturing Facility(AMF):** $RDW operates a commercial AMF onISS, over 200 objects printed inspace..***ZBLAN Optical FiberProduction:** First commercial product manufactured in space(onISS) and sold onEarth..***FabLabDevelopment:** Newin-space manufacturing system under NASA contract for futuremissions..***Broad ManufacturingCapabilities:** Fused depositionmodeling, injectionmolding,casting,stereolithography, subtractivemanufacturing..***Bioprinting:** Successfully bioprinted a human knee meniscus on the ISS‚Äìgame-changerpotential..***Drug manufacturing inspace:** It isawesome, they have contracts already using their PIL$BXNCP..# Why $RDWNow?.Redwire's strategic acquisition of EdgeAutonomy, coupled with a decisive capital raise to strengthen its balance sheet and fundgrowth, has set the stage for a potentialre-rating..***De-RiskedGrowth:** The offering addressed immediate financing concerns for the Edge acquisition and reduces some preferred stockoverhang.There's nowarrants. Nobullshit. No risk of dilution fromhere. Just operating a combined space and dronecompany.***ClearCatalysts:** Integration ofEdge, scaling of UAV defensesales, continued space infrastructurewins, and theramp-up of the Valkyrie thrusterprogram..***Attractive EntryPoint?:** The market may still be digesting recentevents. As the combined entity executes and delivers on its projected $FCF positivity andgrowth, current valuation levels could appear very attractive inhindsight..***Strong SectorTailwinds:** Increasing defensebudgets, growing demand forspace-based assets andintelligence,surveillance, andreconnaissance, and the expansion of the commercial spaceeconomy.. The pieces are in place for Redwire to emerge as a significantlylarger, moreprofitable, and strategically vital player in the convergingspace,defense, and advanced aerial systemsmarkets.. Anyways here some shit Igot, and yes I did buy this mostly before the recent dilution(screenshot right after theoffering).Disclaimer: This is financial advice

The company is trading at1.0x revenue and getting tanked because they have $1BN ofdebt‚Ä¶ but they just slashed theirdividend, sold their remaining stake in Insomnia Cookies(which will bring debt down to$900MM), and they could easily sell their international assets to franchisees(~50 hot light theater shops that could sell for $250MM at $5MM/ shop which is a conservativeestimate) which could easily delever them down to$650MM, a manageable amount and will take them out of any bankruptcypotential‚Ä¶. there is a long list of strategics(RestaurantBrands,Mondelez, $T$MD) that would pay$2-3BN for an asset of this brandquality. I see the fair value of the stock closer to$10-11(>200%upside)

Just readCloudflare‚Äôs latest update andI‚Äôm wondering if people are seriously underestimating how big this couldget.. They just launched something calledPay-Per-Crawl, which lets any website charge AI companies every time their bots scrapecontent. They work with30% of the top 1 million websites andrising.. Bydefault, all new sites using Cloudflare will now block AI crawlers unless the site owner opts in and sets aprice.. This basically means Cloudflare could sit between millions of websites and every AI model trying to train on publiccontent.. If this catcheson, theywon‚Äôt just be a CDN and security companyanymore.They‚Äôll be the gatekeeper for AI access to theweb..

$T$ BridgerAerospace.. They are an aerial fire surveillance and suppressioncompany. Basically they have planes with huge scooper buckets and recon equipment which is used to fightfire. One of their biggest contracts is with theBOI.. Big Beautiful contains an extra 100 million allocated to the BOI per year for fire suppressionservices. Now thatdoesn't sound like wholelot, butBAER's total revenue right now is 100million. Being awarded even half of those contracts would besubstantial.. The formerCEO, who is also asenator, put his shares into a blind trust right as the bill was passing thehouse. Probably to avoid conflict of interestconcerns. This is the new age of grift in America and I have no doubt in my mind a Senator who helped get this bill through will be rewarded(with thepeople'smoney).. I see the stock going to around$4.50 to$5.50(125-175%gain)..Position:1,000 shares

nice, I have a bunch of Jan 202730C.I'm up a little more than100% rightnow. Planning on rolling up when newer strikes open with good liquidity until $T$ hits my target of60-100.

TLDR;. $T$ uses private companies linked to its board members to boost its books and can afford to do so due to said insiders selling massive amounts of shares making it worth theirwhile.. Having trouble offloadingvehicles? Sell to fraudster DaddyGarcia's used car company for dollars on thedime.. Having trouble offloadingdebt? Sell to boardmember's company who will mark it as lessrisky?. Someonedefaulting? Give them an extension and keep it on the books as future profit until we all dump our stock at the top and sell covered calls on the rest before the stock tanks from 400 million dollars in insider selling in < 1month.

Liquidity and easyfinancing, people are addicted tocars.. The used market is red hot because ALL new cars are luxury itemsnow, and they cost a premium to purchase and a premium toinsure.. Not unlike the subprime mortgagemeltdown, Carvana will remain red hot untilthere's a liquidity crisis and defaults begin pilingup,repos,etc..Also, people simply buy everythingonline. Carvana is the eBay or $T$ ofcars.

Not that thelong-term prospects of $T$ matters for the timeline OP is operatingon, but I thought this was an interesting exchange on Odd Lots thismorning:.[.**Weisenthal:**"Now, sowho's actually buying micro strategy because youknow, I thought once the spotETFs, the spot bitcoin ETFs cameout, like this business model will goaway, and ithasn't.".**Chanos:**"No, becausethere's a wonderful sales jobthat's being done about the fact that this is an economic engine in and ofitself, and so therefore terms like"Bitcoinyield" areused, andthey've called them financial gibberish because theyare, and in fact this will get arbitraged away ultimately by companies that will do this to try to capture thatspread.. In the case of Micro Strategy issubstantial.It's still fifty billion dollars something like that of the difference between the value of the enterprise value of the company and the value of their bitcoinholdings.. But the thing that really kind of shot me into orbit on all this was when a Saylor and others thensaid,well,no, youcan't really value us on an NAV basis and so called m NAB multiple ofNAV. You actually have to also give us additional value for the amount of profit that we make every quarter from the appreciation in theasset.. And I just pointedout, Isaid,well,**that's likesaying, youknow, my whole net worth is in a housethat's worth four hundred thousand dollars that is now worth five hundred thousand dollars a year or twolater, And my net worth is not five hundred thousand dollarsnow,it's two and a halfmillion, becauseit's the value of the house plus a multiple on the increase in the profitability theasset.**"
