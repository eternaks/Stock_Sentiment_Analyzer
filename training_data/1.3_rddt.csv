$CRCL in free fall
Someone here just bought the $TSLA 6/27 $375C I sold.
$GOOGL and $AMD pumping? You had a good run bols but this is a bad sign for the overall market.
Of course I sold $AMD at $95.. Just another paper handed fuck of a decision.
Guys please pray for me. I just bought 33 $CRCL $55 PUTS 1/15/2027 for essentially half my portfolio. I‚Äôm nervous
Could‚Äôve had some nice vacation money‚Ä¶ but no $AMD puts ü§°
My portfolio was 99% $NVDA until I sold it yesterday. Fuck my life

"$NVDA is only one tip of the index which screws with the indices. The markets have hit the top, a double top. There is no more great news coming from the markets to send it higher."
i crashed $TSLA bcuz i bought
"Don't pay attention to the negativity on $TSLA. The current negativity is just LIBTARDS ranting wondering where their binky is. Stay the course, give it a year and you will be happy. Invest long term. Stay away from day trades and algorithms. Tesla is well divested in many things, most dont realize that."
Buy $INTC and kill it.
"Alright degenerates, here‚Äôs the deal. I shoved my entire portfolio into $KALV because nothing screams financial wisdom like going all-in on a biotech stock waiting on an FDA decision.. Turns out the FDA Commissioner tried to throw a curveball $CRL at it‚Ä¶ but the scientific chads inside the FDA said ‚Äúnah bro, that‚Äôs illegal,‚Äù and blocked it like prime Dikembe Mutombo.. No safety issues. No efficacy problems. Just some bureaucratic clown show that almost nuked my tendies. But guess what? We‚Äôre still in the game. Stock dipped. Then it resurrected. Jesus-tier recovery.. üß† Am I an idiot? Probably.. üöÄ Am I onto something? Also probably.. üéØ Am I holding until the FDA blesses us in July? You bet your margin account I am..

I bet the whole damn account on $KALV ‚Äì FDA roulette edition üé∞üíä
"$KALV has entered VALUEHALLa! For those that joined me, enjoy your tendies:)!!!"
"Hey guys, $KALV got APPROVAL! LFG!!!!"
"Holding $KALV stock is a bet on strong science overcoming political noise. The company's core asset, Sebetralstat, has shown strong and unequivocal clinical data in its Phase 3 trials, indicating a high probability of approval on a scientific basis. The drug is positioned to be the first and only oral, on-demand treatment in a multi-billion-dollar market, creating immense upside potential. Furthermore, reports that the FDA's scientific body defended the application signal confidence in the data, and the company is well-funded to weather the current storm. For an investor with a high risk tolerance, the asymmetric risk-reward ratio makes holding the position a compelling speculative opportunity."
"Good luck man. I put 95% of my IRA with Robinhood into CSPs on $NMRA and lost my ass. I own 4,000 shares at a cost of $7.5/ea and they‚Äôre worth ~80¬¢ each now. Biopharm is dangerous business."
Bought SPY calls last Friday Iran decides to pop off eating away my confidence all weekend. Panic sold my calls in Robinhood first thing Monday but decided to hold onto the calls in SoFi. Sold those the next day at a 6k profit and rolled it all into $RDDT calls. Sold off those this morning. .

Went all in last year in $AMD with an average of 135. Down 50% few months ago but averaged down along the way and Finally broke even today. Not selling till it hits 500 and this position turns 5M in 2026. Initial post: . 
What a retard‚Ä¶ no one cares if your portfolio diversity is 100% $AMD. You act like there hasn‚Äôt been more retarded portfolio diversifications in here.
Honestly $AMD has legs to go higher. I‚Äôm just trading it so I have Jan 2026 calls.
You think $AMD will be 500 by 2026?!
What is $AMD doing for it to go up?
"I cashed out, been burned by $AMD too long lol."

"I think spreads are fine, but go for 5-10% returns every 20 days and close those at 40-50% gains and open again, on 45m-2h Bollinger Band alerts.

I am 23 years old and I recently went to rehab and took classes for my mental health.. I was recently a gambling addict and i currently am in debt 100k from taking out personal loans and credit cards.

I have a 3 year old son and I have had a lot of mental breakdowns on how I now am going to lose time spending with him due to me working overtime to pay off my ridiculous debt. It was idiotic and I have learned from my decisions and I am looking to move forward with my life and never ever touch gambling again.. it is going to be a long couple of years to get there with 100 hour weeks. I am coming here to ask any of you to possibly help me move forward.

"Just a word of advice from a fellow $BULL long, in September a bunch of locked shares open up so make sure you dump the $20/25 calls if you are up before then. Might see a big sell off around then"

". This is after a successful play on $AMD.. I'm all in on $GOOGL. Pray for me, brothers!"
My biggest YOLO [150k on $GOOGL calls]
And this is why my $GOOGL shares aren‚Äôt up
My stomach sank when I saw the title of this post‚Ä¶.. I have pretty much my whole portfolio in 650 shares of $GOOGL
Feel like I‚Äôm living under a rock. Why is everyone so bullish on $GOOGL on short term calls?
$GOOGL will likely be down 6% tomorrow
"You went calls on $HIMS. Definitely a degenerate like me. No due diligence because you would‚Äôve known GLP-1 (which is their money maker) is no longer allowed to be compounded, they lost partnership with their main GLP-1 provider because they keep selling their compounded ones, and all the other stuff they sell (hair pill, dick pill, etc) are also sold by a lot of other companies like Blue Chew, etc. They haven‚Äôt made any pivot so why would you give them that amount in a short period of time?.

"$GOOGL has very serious risk. This shit isn't just a knee jerk dip. $GOOGL basically dominated searches. Now, people use ChatGPT/Grok, whatever a ton. If you want to buy something unfairly beat up, it's probably $UNH."

My original investment in 2000 $QSEP stocks finally is green again.
I remember when I bought $QSEP at $10 and sold at $40 only to see it run up to $100. Good times!
For months and months $AMD was the shittiest stock. Now $AMD is pumping and $GOOGL is the shittiest stock LMAO
QQQ - Up 1.5%. $AAPL - Down 0.6%. Guess which one I full ported
I‚Äôm laying here next to my gf who I just railed and all I can feel is nothing because $FDX destroyed the last of my money.
"I‚Äôm not falling for $AMD again. Fool me seven times, shame on me"
I personally don't think $CRCL dropped enough today. How about another -15%?
Bro can these scumbags just pump $UNH to 310 tomorrow so i can dump these bags...for fuks sake

$GOOGL and $ADBE are undervalued currently.. Hop in boys we're going to the top!. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER!
The lack of $RDDT talk around here is a classical presentation of regardedness.
I stopped being a bitch and finally went all in on $ASTS this morning. So yeah there is a great chance this is the top.¬†
Who gave $AMD a Moonstone and made it evolve from Advanced Money Destroyer to Advance Money Distributer?
"‚ÄúMommy, how did we get so poor?‚Äù. ‚ÄúYour dad is regarded and bought $GOOGL calls at the top‚Äù"

$AAPL is such a huge piece of shit. Thank you for your attention to this matter
$AAPL really gave up on life the last hour.
Probably going to sell my $ASTS. Feels like its going to go up forever. Daily chart is straight up for 16 days.
Everyone talking about $BB. During Covid I bought the 1/20/2023 $7 strikes for $3.25/each. Bought 30 contracts. Sold them within 4 weeks for $24/EACH. . Those were the days

$AMD flying back to ATH
"I never doubted you, Lisa Su!. Except for all of those months in which $AMD was absolute dogshit."
"Who bought $CRCL at the top, be honestü•¥"
"I‚Äôm long $AMD rn, but yall are about to invoke the curse of Su with all this bullish $AMD talk"
The amount of people in here hoping that $CRCL will go back up after a 800% run in two weeks is crazy. Yall really thought this shit wasn‚Äôt coming down?
Has $GOOGL tried unplugging it and plugging it back in?
bro what are these $AAPL Cash ads that are specifically targeting against Venmo ü§£ü§£ü§£
"When $PLTR crashed to single digits, I had an ordered typed in to buy 500 2 yr leaps that were like $1-$4 each due to being ridiculously out of the money. I decided against it but it would have made me a multi millionaire. Can‚Äôt dwell on that shit. Sucks, but that‚Äôs the game we play."
"That reminds me of when I swung a $SMCI call 3 weeks out, with my last $400 and sold it the following day because there‚Äôs no way it‚Äôs gonna keep going up, right? RIGHT? . 3 weeks later it was clocking $38K. I cried..a lot"
"I had an $MU play like that, it killed me!! I played $MU many times, mostly made money, lost a couple times, then they finally broke out & I missed it!!. Whatever tf i bought instead lost $, wanted to scream!!"
"Meta in 2022, Pltr ....next up is $GOOGL. Look forward, don't look back. That's already done"
Was reading a spy novel written a couple years ago. One of the subplots they were using $PLTR to track someone through OSINT‚Ä¶.bored wife and friends going on about their capabilities bought some of the stock ($12) it was so interesting (not enough of course) never gonna sell.
"Win some and lose some, and live to trade another day. Imagine how I feel, I bought $PLTR back in the day, about 1500 shares, and sold all at about $15. Wish I would have held on, lol."
"Tomorrow when you trade SPX again, look at the VIX, $VOLD and $ADD before"
"And then I tellz them I‚Äôm going to take picturezzz and I‚Äôll seez you in a few monthzzz. We‚Äôll, here we are, a couple of months after the tarifs shit show and as expected, the retards are still eating peanuts with their nutshells in order to have more nutrients, while $RKLB is on the cusp of heading higher, making me a lot richer. Keep in mind I‚Äôm europoor so this is taking into account the -15% devaluation of the $ against the ‚Ç¨. Stay strong retards you can do it to, you just have to stop being retarded  . "
"$RKLB , $LUNR and $ASTS were the best bets someone could have bet his fortune"
Some people call me a space cowboy (im all in on $RKLB AND ASTS)
"Ahaha no way, a fellow $RKLB holder! I‚Äôm new here, but gladly bought back when it was a SPAC. Literally purely based on a friend‚Äôs recommendation. Dealt through the hard year+ and am happy with where I‚Äôm at now üòä. I‚Äôve also made some bad investment decisions btw‚Ä¶ this is one of my best."
I'm currently flying on $ASTS.  When do I pull the trigger??
Lmao I knew $RKLB was heavily involved based on the chart
I bought calls last year when it was $12 and it went up to like $38 eventually. Sold for like $25K profit. Then it went back under $20 again after. Definitely sell man. Bth $ASTS and $RKLB have cycles.
"so since this option is in the money, can you sell it **NOW**  for $4,776 profit?. so what if by 1/16/26 the price of $ASTS is still $52.75, and you don't sell? then this option will expire worthless am I right? and you don't get anything in return"
My $GOOGL put yolo gonna print tmr.

I already had some arguments with people on here about it. Doesn‚Äôt matter though cause $TSLA will still go up so just buy calls I guess
"$TSLA FSD more murderous than Ted Bundy? Already priced in,. Believe it or not, calls. everyone knows $TSLA is a sex robot company anyways wtf do cars have to do with the stonk. Thank you for your attention to this matter"
"Weirdly people are not buying pony.ai which shows great advancement in the robotaxi line.

$COIN $CRCL PUTS YOLO
$CRCL is valid but coin is crazy to put
Way too early and volatile to go for this. Good luck nonetheless. When you see people posting losses on $CRCL puts that's your buy puts signal
"Godspeed man. I follow you on $CRCL, put in an order at 6.0, not sure if it is gonna hit. When it rains it pours."
"Yeah think your timing will be off on COIN. They are predicting Genius and Clarity Act passing through congress in August. Look at the bounce the stock just turned off Genius Act getting through only the Senate. Firm believer we will see a run up finally breaking 400 sometime in Aug/Sept. COIN will also have an earnings report around Aug 7th. Don‚Äôt forget like 50% of $CRCL profits fall in COINs pocket. How far it will go I dunno, but hoping we at least see some stabilization for a period in the 400s is my prediction over the next few months. . I‚Äôm a LT straight stock holder with 5800 shares that I‚Äôve had for around 2-3 yrs now. This stock is going to get me to retirement."
$CRCL puts seem like as much of a sure thing as you could get but I am too poor
I'm in on $CRCL but have to wait for market open tomorrow.
$CRCL ok but why coin
"crazy putting COIN tbh. $CRCL you might have a case but COIN is crazy. Not in favor of SPY but it's your call. Market goes up by nature, I wouldn't waste my money shorting markets"
"I actually got 10k in $100 7/18 put, but COIN put is a no from me dawg. If $CRCL goes up more then I'll prob buy more $100 8/15 put"
Too early for $CRCL puts but god speed. Edit: circle puts that low*

Only thing not priced in is Elon running for President in 2028. This would be +100% on $TSLA. So from $1K to $2K at this point.

Been there before... $UPS kept dropping the delivery slips at my doorstep but I knew better than to accept that package... Just gotta take that loss like a man champ

"Update to my past post: [. I am doubling down on my last position because of a few things: . \-CTX320 data expected in the next week; gene editing for Cardiovascular disease. \-**A company with a similar program was acquired by Eli Lily for $1.3B** last week, leading to acquisition rumors for $CRSP Tx and providing confidence in their approach as well as gene editing overall ([Verve Tx Buyout](. \-FDA is seeking to cut red tape to fast track approvals in cell and gene therapies¬†([RFK looks to slash red tape](. \-Short interest still at \~25%. \-Institutional ownership at \~75%. Position: . [7\/18 45C seem like a layup, adding more on dips](. "
$CRSP Tx - Catalyst anticipated this week
"Update here from One Big Beautiful Bill for those who care: . \-The bill has provisions for Orphan drugs, which say that Medicare can't negotiate on price (CRISPR's one approved drug treats two different orphan diseases), so they will get the full $2.2M list price. \-Biotechs benefit from the R&D tax deduction provision as well. This makes them more attractive for acquirers who can deduct the biotech's losses on their taxes. $CRSP has close to $1.5B in losses over the last decade, so if they get acquired someone can write off that loss (at 21% tax rate that is \~$300M). . Hypothetically their value is the DCF + cash + operating loss tax deduction. They have $1.9B in cash and $300M tax shield. At a $4.5B market cap they still seem too cheap."
$CRSP enters Russell 3000 June 27th. You have that catalyst too.
"Been buying since last year and adding 80% of my pay each month, upwards of 5.5k a month till I own 0.01% of google. . I wanna name my gravestone ü™¶ have $GOOGL embossed W gold ü™ô."
$GOOGL will be my retirement ticket üé´
It is just like Microsoft in 2012.. $GOOGL is a money machine.
"F it, I‚Äôll double down today on my 2026 Jan calls. there‚Äôs just no fucking reason for a random 5% drop. No other mag stock gets hit from bogus headlines like $GOOGL."
"For $GOOGL, I always picked up 5-10 shares when it dipped under 165, and 5-10 more for every $5 dip below that.  From last September till now, I have built it from 0 to almost 100 shares with average cost in 150s, lol.. It seems it always goes forward 3 steps, and then back up 2.9 steps."
"PEOPLE FORGET $GOOGL WAS $3,000+  BEFORE THE STOCK SPLIT A FEW YEARS AGO"
110% agree. I just keep DCA into $GOOGL
$GOOGL WTF
This and $UNH are my two favorite long holds
I would normally be super bullish on $GOOGL right now but seeing all you regards sharing the same opinion isn‚Äôt a good sign
"Also a leader in Quantum, neck and neck w $IBM. $IBM has grown a ton based on their position in the field, crickets on $GOOGL tho."
"There's so much under the hood of Goog, they have many assets beyond search, it's a cash cow and will probably continue to generate tons of cash, since the searches that drive the most revenue for $GOOGL probably are still pretty useful when googling, most of the crap I use LLMs for are deeper research or understanding, not so much buying things or looking for a lawyer or doctor. Still very early innings. Plus they have so many levers to pull and tweak to keep generating tons on üí∞üí∞üí∞"
$GOOGL will be at 175 for the next 30 years¬†
"Going down amigo, ChatGPT taking over. . Feds Anti-trust lawsuit and selling off chrome. . $AAPL might cancel the search deal then or renegotiate.. Aws and azure eating gcloud‚Äôs lunch."
Why buy $GOOGL instead of GOOGL? You don‚Äôt want voting rights?
That‚Äôs $200M right? 0.01% of $GOOGL. . You‚Äôre not making it.
$AMD gonna fuckin pop. $200 this year
Why $GOOGL over any other?
$GOOGL need a snakeoil-type salesman like elon and the stock will easily go up to $300
Bet ya 5k that $AMZN beats $GOOGL. You won‚Äôt.
"It better be. If you're the dude who bought 130K in $GOOGL calls, and if that is 80% of your investment portfolio, then Wendy's will come calling if those calls don't come through."
Might take my $PLTR gains and go into $GOOGL
"Damn I liked $GOOGL too, but after seeing the attention it's gotten here in the last few days, no wonder it's dropped.."
One of us Masochists!!! I own $AMD and GOOG!!!
"Working in SEO and actually dealing with them..... Naw dog, this ain't it, $GOOGL is a clown show these days.. Run a set of searches on DuckDuckGo, Bing, and $GOOGL. . Then run a set of questions on ChatGPT and Gemini, you'll see how far $GOOGL has fallen."
ChatGPT gonna single handedly wipe out $GOOGL
$GOOGL might die with ai. Have you heard of perplexity ai?
$GOOGL search is dead take the loss and get out
$GOOGL is the worst tech company to buy right now. Literally any other is way better
"dude $GOOGL is so done. I did an analysis on them recently and unpacked that ~85% of their revenue comes from their original products which were invented over 20 years ago. They could have just kept Search and YouTube and routed all profits to shareholders, and their value would possibly be higher."
Ah yes $GOOGL with YouTube being its best asset and also making basically no revenue
$GOOGL yolo.. 1/3rd done 2/3rd left
I pray you win big cause if you win big all my shares that have not moved for the past year and a half will go up as well.  But yeah...not a move I would make having watched my shares go nowheres in 2 years.  Did you make this move on some news we don't know? LOL  Anyways fair thee well investor!  May we finally get some winds on the $GOOGL stock blowing it in the right direction.
Agree this is going up. But just don't know when. :) I'm also long on $GOOGL and had it since 150ish. Good luck to us all.
I don't know how to make money on $GOOGL
All logical thinking and analyses point to $GOOGL being significantly undervalued. So it will continue to underperform because WSB overwhelmingly loves it.
$GOOGL is the new intel.
15% of my portfolio is in $GOOGL.
Didn‚Äôt know $GOOGL can be an asset for margin.
Someone in this group recently called $GOOGL a hunk of shit and I don‚Äôt think they could have been more accurate. I finally sold all mine
"I am all in on $HIMS. My view is that this is an overreaction as outlined by the $HIMS CEO on X (. This is still a company growing at more than 100% per year at 40x forward earnings. The Trump administration will continue to deregulate across the board, so I don‚Äôt believe their core business model is at risk for at least the next 3 years. Macro liquidity is going higher along with $HIMS continuing to be a retail favorite. This is an opportunity to buy a market leader at a significant discount. Could it go lower? Absolutely, but in my mind the likelihood of this stock making significant new highs this year is quite good.. Disclaimer: Not financial advice . I am not a financial advisor. In fact, I can barely advise myself. This post is for entertainment purposes only and should not be interpreted as a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any securities. Any resemblance to financial wisdom is purely coincidental."
$2.3m $HIMS yolo
Yo OP did you hedge with puts? Last time $HIMS dropped 30% it dropped 20% next day
A halfway decent marketing campaign from $AMZN pharmacy and $HIMS goes discount bin until it gets bought up. Just my $0.02.
"I want to invest in $HIMS but I cant get past the Mass Compounding accusations from Novo.. How do you feel about the claim of Mass Compounding?  If a drug is short supply the FDA allows pharmacies to compound a patient tailored dosage pharmaceutical currently under patent. However the FDA already ruled that $GLP 1 is no longer in short supply and all three $GLP 1 receptor drugs are under Patent until 2030.. Pharmacy/Telehealth companies like BlueChew are able to compound Viagra (generic Sildenfil) because the drug is generic, is a unique dosage and does not hold a New Drug patent with the FDA."
$HIMS will be a dead company in five years !remind me 5 years
"The dip in $UNH is irrational, but this one, idk man. Suppose it turns out they are cutting pills together with low quality meds from China lmao, it would be so over"
People love to short $HIMS. It was a good day for them
If you wanted to throw away 2.$MMM you could‚Äôve just given it to me
"this is the best trade to make with $2M ? . This is your money . I would put it into Stanley Black and Decker . sell 300 $60 strike puts ($480) per contract Jan expiration. take the $144,000 and buy $HIMS  shares"
Some bullish retard was going on about this stock last week. I bought puts the moment I saw their stupid $HIMS post. LMAO ü§£
"Feel that the drop today was an overreaction. Scaled light into $HIMS today, up on it currently. Nowhere near the amount you dropped though. Best of luck!"
"Bweh, can't see future for them after losing $NVO. something very shady is going on. Those accusations aren't light.."
$HCAI ‚úÖÔ∏è üé´
First mistake was trusting the $HIMS CEO üòÇ
Does anyone know if $HIMS or $AMZN pharmacy have plans to be able to provide controlled substances. This seems like one area that traditional pharmacies still have the edge in.
$AMZN is launching their own subscription based health service. I wonder how it will affect Hims.
I'm looking at $HIMS here as well because they can just continue to use the compounds for much less money and expand their profit margins
Space waffles everyday $ASTS
"What stocks are at good entry points long term $GOOGL, Lunr, BBAI?"
$HIMS | $19.5k in 3 Minutes!!!
Where is that guy who YOLO $HIMS 2x?
How'd you know where to put $HIMS in?
If you had $HIMS on your watchlist you would have seen it was down a lot pre market. I first saw it down at like 8 am. Immediately went to stock twits to see why and saw the $NONOF news. I didn‚Äôt have the powder to pick up puts at open but i was eyeing the 6/27 $40‚ÄôS they were 5 cents. Not hard to have made some money on the momentum upon market open
"Somehow someone recommended me $HIMS. For no reason at all, a few days ago. Meh. Fingers crossed $MDBH takes off."
. üåï $BULL
how do you lose on a stock like $ASTS
Only $ASTS loser alive rn...
"$ASTS is for owning shares and LEAPS, otherwise gg"
You will be fine $ASTS will go down to the shitter. They have no revenues and they will need to dilute again. Hold on you will be rewarded
"$AMD will be fine, definitely would‚Äôve given yourself a few more weeks though. $HIMS is cooked, cut those losses and roll it into $AMD. $AMD will be the biggest winner this year and next."
"$HIMS won't recover this week, at least very unlikely. $AMD is a good bet,...Good luck"
My $HIMS puts would be cooked if yours hit. Good luck to you and your marriage!
I also got the $HIMS dip.
$HIMS is done
$HIMS is surging. Those will pan out
Don‚Äôt listen to these idiots about $HIMS I bought a bunch of shares today but again they‚Äôre shares so
"I have the same bets, $AMD and $GOOGL. . We can't both be retarded, right?"
The volume on $HIMS calls today was ridiculous.
"$AMD calls, not bad. $HIMS tho. oh boy you better strap in"
"I sold you one of those $CLBR calls. I own shares and have problems taking profits so I sold covered calls to take profits in tranches. Good luck my friend, I think you are also cooked"
And might have a chance‚Ä¶ $HIMS is cooked.
"$HIMS is done, going to follow Beyond Meat and Moderna to the bottom"
His $AMD looks fine. Edit: lolnvm didn't see where all the contracts were at. ü§£
$AMD ain't it brother
Might work. I‚Äôm big on $AMD this year but who knows by your exp ha
Oh dear‚Ä¶GOOG will help‚Ä¶.and $HIMS has a shot (the book is hopeful.) Maybe roll and consolidate? Good luck OP.. (I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll add FOBI to the watchlist‚Ä¶.)
"$AMD calls still sounds reasonable, but I have a feeling $HIMS might test lower levels."
Well your $AMD printed
Did $AMD save u?
"Damn man. Why these stocks? $AMD consistently loses people money and $HIMS just had their worst day ever‚Ä¶hope it works out for you but damn. And all these different plays, expirations, I mean Jesus, really over complicating it for yourself."
$HIMS.US plunges over 17% in pre-market trading after reports emerge that Novo Nordisk has terminated its collaboration
$NVO is also down 5% premarket. Wonder what happened.
"NOVO‚Äôs management is absolute garbage. They keep disappointing, and are shit at communication. . And in under a month they stopped their collaboration with $HIMS, on things that were known before they made the deal. . Plus they fired their CEO without even having a replacement ready."
"Ozempic is so last year any way they made this new shit called Retatrutide and it‚Äôs like 500% better I‚Äôm down 10 fucking pounds in a week, literally just haven‚Äôt eaten, don‚Äôt even want to. . Anyway friendship ended with $HIMS sketchy grey market compounder friendship beginned"
$HIMS should be down 50% shortly after their primary source of upside accused them of being criminals.
"""Thanks for the free customer acquisitions, $HIMS....adios."" -Novo"
So is Novo upset because $HIMS are putting ‚Äúpatient safety at risk‚Äù or upset because $HIMS are offering a more cost effective alternative that would take market share from Novo?
I think there is a good chance $NVO went into this partnership knowing they‚Äôd rip the rug from under them eventually. They were none too pleased with that Super Bowl ad and I‚Äôm sure they got a decent amount of people started on sema
"god damnit, $HIMS was carrying my portfolio for a while, this is a huge L, yall think it will come back? time to buy?"
"It was back to $55? Wow i bought some when it was around $20 late last year because of some regard here saying that it was going to be bought by $AMZN and whatnot, but i chickened out and sold when it fell from $60 to $50 a few months ago. Then it went back to $20 something and i felt like Buffett."
"imagine buying short-term puts last week that didn't expire last week but expired this week instead... this kind of huge swings rarely happens, but it shows the importance of time premium sometimes. I scalped $HIMS last week but didn't buy any puts to hold over the weekend lol, sadge"
"Good. I dislike them not because of their high prices, but they promised discreet packaging. I dunno how discreet it is when $HIMS is right there on the return address. Add to the fact they're doing a shit ton of advertising¬†"
Would have though this was bullish for $NVO plus it's only been collaborating for a month but whatever.¬†
$HIMS 260k gain in 2 days
"First the $UNH guy now this guy.. That you're insider trading is one thing, that you are proudly posting it on here is another. That's some big hope they'll never investigate."
this is paper trade lol. $IBKR highlights the numbers in simulated trading
Peak comedy was when some Ber bought $60K of $TSLA puts yesterday and wrote a text wall of highly retarded analysis only for the $TSLA stock to go up 8% today. I can't stop laughing at this shit
"TODAY WE CARRIED OUT A $POCI STRIKE AGAINST SPY, $TSLA AND $OXY PUTS. ALL STRIKES WERE SUCCESSFUL AND THE SHORTS OF BEARS WERE COMPLETELY AND TOTAL OBLITERATED. IF BEARS ATTACK OUR MARKETS IN RESPONSE IT WILL GET MUCH WORSE!. THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER."
$130K $GOOGL call bro fuk. $60K $TSLA put bro bigly fuk all in one day. RIP in peace bros
You have better chances betting against the United States of America than you do against $TSLA bro what the fuck is this thing
"Between USA, Iran and Israel, the only casualty seems to be $GOOGL."
$CLBR LAST DISCOUNT üö®üö®üö®
Let me guess. $GOOGL dumps 5% again at open and $TSLA moons
"$TSLA, missing it‚Äôs revenue: +10%. $TSLA, robotaxi shenanigans: +10%. I do not understand this stock anymore."
$GOOGL down 8% in a week. Surely this is an easy 8% gain right?
Need $HIMS to hit 30 so I don‚Äôt feel bad for missing it all those months ago
Whats up with all these bots pushin $GOOGL on us
Objectively $AMZN deserves $300 per share
$HIMS really just had a -35% on almost 200 million volume lmao
"$ASTS on a generational run these past few weeks, sending people into retirement every hour."
"Is it insider trading if you're the CEO of Novo Nordisk and you bought puts on $HIMS before picking a fight in public? If no, I have no idea why the CEO didn't just load up on $HIMS puts before."
Now we just need a ceasefire with $GOOGL
"If I had bought $CRWV $CRCL $ASTS $RKLB $OSCR a month ago, I would have retired but here I m with $AAPL and $GOOGL."
Someone out there lost their life savings on a $HIMS yolo
$CLBR -üíéüíé hands
-It was a huge pump that night.. -How big was it?. -It was so big that even $GOOGL was green.. -Holy fuck.
$GOOGL must be one of the most hated stocks in the Wall Street the way it‚Äôs being treated LMAO
Bought $AMD and $GOOGL on the same day a few months ago. $AMD  +40%. $GOOGL +.5%
"$CRCL only up 9.6% today, one of their worst days in history."
Waymo? More like I need to buy waymo calls on google because $TSLA robotaxi only had 4 accidents in a 10 hour period during the public test with safety drivers in the cars
"Down $20K today, thanks $HIMS"
"God! Please give $HIMS +10% day, and I‚Äôll never touch options again! . Today options today after 2 months was the most regarded mistake even !. Please god please please üò≠"
$HIMS changing name to THEMS
Something tells me to buy more $UVXY.
$GOOGL still gonna shit the bed and drag it down as usual.
"I give up on DD, scanning news etc. No matter what happens, bad goes down .5 percent, good, goes up 5 times as much, I am just going to get 0,1,or 2 $DTG calls from now until 2094"
almost all my sells in the past 2 weeks. I almost sold my $MSFT calls thi morning too...but instead i tried to learn and buy another one. Then i regretted only buying one.
Bought $270 $CRCL calls Friday. Sold them at market open today when $CRCL was at $245 ü•≤
"Some advice: don‚Äôt buy same day exp options after 10:00 am. Any bought at open should be closed before 12 or have a very good risk mitigation strategy ready. Buy next day exp if you really want to try a short trade. Otherwise, buy 45 days out. TIME IS YOUR FRIEND. . I only buy $LPTX (1 year out or more) options because the chance you‚Äôre up at some point is the highest and if things go wrong right away you have plenty of time to make it up."
"Sound like someone is selling his shares.... by the way, is the rumor about $TRUMP and $BTC will be used as gold certificate for upto the half of the gold in Fort Knox?. The coin holders can cash in their crypto for physical gold. The crypto will be deposit into 'strategic' US crypto reserve."
Rolling $NVDA gains into $GOOGL
Why everyone going deep into $GOOGL lately?
wtf. I did the same today. sold my $NVDA after a long hold and ported it into $GOOGL.
. All the regards buying $GOOGL right now
"Highly regarded to get out of $NVDA before the 25 June catalyst. No way $GOOGL will match the $NVDA upside.. For the record and future reference:. $NVDA @ 145.81 rn. $GOOGL @ 167.55 rn. Let's review in a month, or two, or ten."
Should have rolled it into $AMD.
Anyone else grabbing a seat before $HOOD annual meeting?
"$PLTR, GRRR and $BBAI."
I‚Äôm sorry $UNH bag holders
"options arent the move with $UNH, its a shares play."
"Bruh you‚Äôre only down 13%, chill this ain‚Äôt even a real WSB loss until you‚Äôre questioning your life choices at -80%. You still got time before 8/1, $UNH just needs to pump a bit and you‚Äôre golden. Don‚Äôt paper hand it yet, just breathe and maybe touch some grass."
I‚Äôm holding and everyone else should be too $UNH will have a moon candle this week
"I took a position around $295, when I saw $UNH go up to $315 I sold my shares, took a small profit and haven't messed with $UNH since. . Glad I did, $UNH has lost it's meme status for now, so I'm leaving it alone until the hype builds back up."
"My $2.7k call expiring 6/27 is evaporated lol... I got cod timing and $UNH is at 297 a share, FML. Goodbye to all that money"
the next $PLTR
"Well if its not options, then hats off to you. I lost about 1k last year gambling with $ASTS options. Literally last summer when the boom happened."
. 900 $ASTS shares at a $14 average. I was trying to squeeze premium because of $ASTS high volatility and it blew up recently. It‚Äôs covered calls but it still kinda sucks in hindsight. 
Man I knew my $XOM calls expired too soon. I should‚Äôve rolled them. Hahaha
Nitrogen stocks like $CFBK and $UAN üöÄ - the world needs nitrogen to eat üåΩ

$CLBR üî´ 77 is my lucky number
Just an FYI 2 Wall Street lawyers put out some news yesterday looking to ‚Äúinvestigate‚Äù $CLBR to make sure it was providing proper valuation to its stockholders. Tbh seems like smoke (probably because the lawyers have a bone to pick with DTJ or the gun situation). That said I‚Äôm in 35 shares and I‚Äôm watching it slide to get in on 35 more before mergerü§°

$TSLA announces Robotaxi. GOOGL: ded. $TSLA up 9%. $GOOGL announces new city for Waymo. GOOGL: up 1%
The premiums on $CRCL are FUCKED
My god $GOOGL. Do you even know you can be green for one damn day
no sympathy for the retards losing their ass on $CRCL rn
$CLBR lost in out 
$CLBR lost
"Someone with a truth social account should spam $CLBR, PEW, grabagun to daddy üçä. Maybe he will respond and pump that shit like he did with Tesler a few months back. That should pump it back up again."
My first YOLO.. $CLBR
Been in $CLBR a few weeks now and following all the boards here. Figured I‚Äôd share my position finally. 
First YOLO $CLBR
$TSLA $72K ‚Äî> $98K IN 3 HOURS
"Someone in r/thetagang prob gonna crosspost this ""ha some retard in WSB bought my calls!!"" but hey, I'm in for $3K worth of $175C i bought BEFORE power hour thinking it wouldn't just... keep... dropping smh but it did. I think we survive this, $GOOGL is very deeply oversold on the RSI and historically, a large relief rally follows that."
I‚Äôm gonna yolo on $GOOGL tomorrow. Supporting you bro
-$117k if $GOOGL opens at $165
"I had 100% port in $GOOGL with 6 figures, sold for a loss on Friday close, got back in at at 181. It will open lower"
"Should‚Äôve gone all in on $NVDA like the rest of us, bro. $GOOGL is for cowards."
Hahahah I‚Äôm there with u bro. $GOOGL call üíπüíπüíπ
I own 50 shares of $GOOGL and I am tempted to buy puts just because of that dude...
$GOOGL bruh?
"Good god. Im a $GOOGL bull, but god damn good sir."
F*ck it bro you‚Äôve inspired me to buy $GOOGL calls tomorrow morning too ‚úäüèª
"GET OUT NOW.. Yes, TACO and all that, but not before massive pain has been inflicted. This will *in all likelihood* take more than a week to resolve, and in fact, the odds are high that things will greatly escalate from here.. The market will bleed *heavy* this week and there is no way that $GOOGL will close ATM in five fucking days. Get out get out get out. And maybe buy some oil."
$GOOGL never moves when you want it to move. Cut your loses tomorrow.
"Why the fuck would you throw it into $GOOGL instead of something that will literally print money, $LMT $XOM GUSH etc. This isn't a YOLO this is the Joker burning a pile of money."
At least this is a YOLO compared to that weakass shit from that 1000 $OXY shares guy.
" If $GOOGL doesn‚Äôt bounce hard, you‚Äôre basically donating to Robinhood."
Unless $GOOGL announces that they quantumed their way to uranus you're cooked
Dude why would you buy garbage like $GOOGL. This is one of the worst stocks to trade.
Sell it first thing Monday $GOOGL going down
I lost 30k on $GOOGL 180 call 6/20. Hope it makes you feel better
"What has to happen in $GOOGL by 6/27 to make your calls print I wonder. Are there any catalysts aside the ongoing antitrust case against $GOOGL, which 90% is going to be ruled out not to Google's benefit?"
$NTCL ‚úÖÔ∏è üíé
$GOOGL said not this week.
$GOOGL YOU
I own $GOOGL too . The Europe mess is not helping and seems like it‚Äôs gonna cling to current levels until further notice . You may get lucky in it tho it‚Äôs gonna be close. . $GOOGL has not gained any steal even tho it‚Äôs a steller company . That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like options gambles cause I would‚Äôve went with what you went with for sure and I would‚Äôve been dead wrong
Robotaxi will kill $GOOGL
Something $GOOGL is about to happen over the next few days. Bigly.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Honestly full porting $GOOGL sounds like the move.  Might join you after a good Coinbase day
NOT $CLCO
$CRCL needs to hesitate
When you buy puts and $CRCL thinks you're shorting $NVDA
Another $GOOGL yolo $180 Aug 15th
Yolo‚Äôd shares and diamond handed. Sold. Will rebuy when $TSLA $300. See my previous YOLO post for proof when I YOLO‚Äôd. . 
$TSLA 7.9k gain shares
Bro really said ‚Äúhold the line‚Äù and meant it üíéüôå. That dip in Feb had me sweating for you but damn you came back swinging. $TSLA to the moon when it hits $300 again üöÄ.
"Will go up a gazillion percent, because of the unlimited potential of having FSD unsupervised 'next year' for over a decade and AI videos of humanoid robots that don't have a business model, with which you can infinitely lure gullible people into buying the stock.. Calls on $TSLA it is!"
$TSLA will keep going up despite everything indicating the opposite should be happening. Nothing new to see here.
"Seems everyone misses it, Melon has been talking about $AL driving the cars, not AI. He has hired a large number of people named $AL to ride in all the cars and drive them remotely."
$TSLA about to moon on a deep red market tomorrow because everyone will think sales will shatter records as oil prices double.
"I've flipped $TSLA for years, nothing crazy, pretty modest chunks, but always done well. 10% - 40% flips every time. I thought there would be a pop with the robotaxi release. Didn't do as well as I thought on it. I'm done tinkering with $TSLA for the foreseable future. Just a land mine waiting to go off IMO."
Pretty sure $TSLA will shoot higher on the news.
"A waymo costs $200K‚Äì$600K per car, while a robotaxi costs $30K. Since you could own a robotaxi and earn money while not using it, you would be responsible for maintaining it. Tesla would receive the data and machine learning insights from it.. Your robotaxi could be used to pick up food and groceries, and I‚Äôd rather have my groceries dropped off by a robotaxi than a human.. Tesla just has a better business model than $GOOGL and all the other self-driving car companies.. Having a human in the passenger seat is more about protecting the car from idiots.. I own Tesla."
I went all in on $UVXY on Friday. I prepped for this üòÇ
hmm guess my $RTX going to print on Mon
I bought puts to hedge against my $ASTS shares. This seems like a win/win for me.
$NVDA will rally 10% and Palantir 50% on Monday open
Somehow‚Ä¶. $TSLA calls still print Monday
"In no particular order:. - Iran news completely overshadows the Robotaxi launch which was likely a sell-the-news event anyways.. - Weekend fake internet money prices point to a selloff in stocks.  $TSLA highly correlated to fake internet money.. - $TX senate vote and signature of Governor requiring all autonomous vehicles to get to Level autonomy in order to operate starting in September.  This is a huge precedent which now means $TSLA robotaxis will take much longer to scale because each State will have its own autonomous driving thresholds and review periods.  Waymo will continue to expand faster than $TSLA.. - Attention now shifts to July 22 earnings.  Sales are pretty much down YoY throughout most of the entire world.  Analyst downgrades are coming.  $TSLA will likely lower full year guidance.. - I expect a class action lawsuit from disgruntled HW3 owners soon because they are all realizing Elon lied about HW3 getting a free upgrade to HW4 and beyond.  It is clear now that HW3 vehicles wont ever have true FSD and the legal liability will be in the tens of billions of dollars.. - Elon is still popping off about one of Mango‚Äôs closest White House aides.  The probability of Elon pissing off Mango again is not insignificant.. - $7,500 EV Tax Credit likely expires at the end of this year.. - Oil spike likely means Fed delays rate cuts further.  High P/E stocks like $TSLA generally suffer more in higher rate environments especially if economic growth is also slowing.. "
$60K on $TSLA Puts:  Why $TSLA Will Be Down Big Next Few Weeks.
The only flaw in your logic is that you're being logical.  I've been burned betting against $TSLA when I expected things like a terrible revenue/earnings report to actually be considered a negative.  Everything bad seems to be good.
OP how did it feel this morning seeing $TSLA not tank with the market despite all the war headlines?
I love seeing the $TSLA shorts get crushed day after day .
No update bro?   I enjoy watching $TSLA and $BTC doubters be wrong for years and years.  Yet still confidently proclaim that the whole market has been wrong all this time and the valuations are crazy.
It's been over half a decade and people are still torching their money on $TSLA puts.
lol clowns been losing money on $TSLA puts since $TSLA went public
I've been in $TSLA stock since the $10 days (2019) and have seen like a million of these posts.. Yet they keep burning their hard-earned money because Elon bad man ü§£
"$TSLA gonna be selling weaponized versions of Optimus to the US government.  Being deployed by weaponized cybertrucks.. Replace ""weaponized"" with ""expensive"".. Way undervalued right now."
Tesla just got some of the best news it could of possibly received. The senate slashed the provision in the BBB that cut ITC from $BESS.
"üòÇ brother, i saw a bunch of people lose money by $TSLA put since 2019"
You forgot that high oil prices is good for $TSLA
Every bear has had their war with $TSLA. . Anytime you get a big drop you have to take profits fast. It will probably tank some this week so sell a bunch of those and buy another set a couple months out if it shoots back up. It‚Äôs an exhausting game but can pay big.  It‚Äôs the same with $CVNA.  . If this market ever goes into a recession / 2022 style downturn these stocks will get smoked but no signs of that yet. . Some big money keeping it propped up. GL!
"As much as I agree with you, that would all make way too much sense. $TSLA just isn't a rational stock these days, and I've been burned betting against it before. I mean, just this year the Q1 earnings were awful, but the stock rallied. I've been avoiding $TSLA like the plague for that reason. Too unpredictable, and none of it seems tied to fundamentals at all."
"I was considering paper handing my $335C tomorrow. That‚Äôs for the boost of confidence. $TSLA $400 EOW. . The fact people confidently proclaim $TSLA is going down long term is insane. The cult following and institutional investment might be delusional, but it‚Äôs real. . Source: I tried to short $CVNA a year ago and almost went bankrupt."
"I would NOT get puts until the end of whatever rise will happen beginning of this week from the Iran strike. I wouldn't trust $TSLA to go down til the market's going down, but then I agree with puts on it."
"And it's gone!. Looking at OP comment history, he loves trash talking about $TSLA and Elon and now his money is all gone."
OP is the reason $TSLA is up today lmao.
WSB finally üåàüåàüêª on $TSLA . $TSLA Stonk go tits up now
$TSLA to $400. Calls it is.
You forgot that the market is forward looking. It's probably calculating what's happening in 2028 when RoboMusk takes $TSLA to the moon literally.
Godspeed ... $TSLA is going to pump to 350
Always inverse wsb. For that reason $TSLA is gonna moon
$TSLA market cap is higher than any other auto maker; it must be as high as the combined market cap of all other auto makers
I hope the person who wrote your puts uses the $60K to buy themselves a $TSLA. What a dumbass.
I lost 250K on $TSLA puts in Spring of 2017. It‚Äôs insane.
$TSLA will be down because everything but oil will be down.
"The threat of Iran war already caused $TSLA to pamp for some reason, maybe govt contracts or rising oil prices. If the war things cools off then maybe there's a sell off in the run up to earnings."
"RoboTaxi was just released in Austin, $TX. Will this help?"
"The Robotaxi thing seems like a very dangerous launch. Listening to Wallstreet Breakfast podcast, analysts in the know were talking about how the latest self-driving tests are still revealing serious flaws in the systems, like being unable to recognize things like one-way signs and school buses' extendable ""stop"" signs. One account even said it blew past a school bus and hit several child-sized dummies without stopping.. Not sure if there's any way to predict when the first deadly malfunction will occur‚Äîat least not with enough accuracy to make high-confidence buys of puts or put debit spreads‚Äîbut I definitely wouldn't feel safe going long on $TSLA for a while."
