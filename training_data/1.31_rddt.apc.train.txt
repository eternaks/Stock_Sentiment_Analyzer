Holding $T$ stock is a bet on strong science overcoming politicalnoise. Thecompany's coreasset,Sebetralstat, has shown strong and unequivocal clinical data in its Phase 3trials, indicating a high probability of approval on a scientificbasis. The drug is positioned to be the first and onlyoral,on-demand treatment in amulti-billion-dollarmarket, creating immense upsidepotential.Furthermore, reports that theFDA's scientific body defended the application signal confidence in thedata, and the company iswell-funded to weather the currentstorm. For an investor with a high risktolerance, the asymmetricrisk-reward ratio makes holding the position a compelling speculativeopportunity.

Yeah think your timing will be off onCOIN. They are predicting Genius and Clarity Act passing through congress inAugust. Look at the bounce the stock just turned off Genius Act getting through only theSenate. Firm believer we will see a run up finally breaking 400 sometime inAug/Sept. COIN will also have an earnings report around Aug7th.Don‚Äôt forget like50% of $T$ profits fall in COINspocket. How far it will go Idunno, but hoping we at least see some stabilization for a period in the 400s is my prediction over the next fewmonths..I‚Äôm a LT straight stock holder with 5800 shares thatI‚Äôve had for around2-3 yrsnow.

Update here from One Big Beautiful Bill for those whocare:.\-The bill has provisions for Orphandrugs, which say that Medicarecan't negotiate on price(CRISPR's one approved drug treats two different orphandiseases), so they will get the full$2.2M listprice.\-Biotechs benefit from theR&D tax deduction provision aswell. This makes them more attractive for acquirers who can deduct thebiotech's losses on theirtaxes. $T$ has close to$1.5B in losses over the lastdecade, so if they get acquired someone can write off that loss(at21% tax rate that is\~$300M).. Hypothetically their value is the DCF + cash + operating loss taxdeduction. They have$1.9B in cash and $300M taxshield. At a$4.5B market cap they still seem toocheap.
