"When $HOOD moons, we all buying yachts, right?"
"Just a note there have always been secondary markets for private equity shares. In the last decade, there have been several startups and marketplace for these rather than just having them happen through brokers or offline, known peer to peer deals.  They were not tokenized, though, and in the US you have to be an accredited investor to access them, sign up for the platform, etc.. So this idea of trading shares in non-publicly traded companies isn‚Äôt new‚Äî The new idea is tokenizing them rather than having to go to that other marketplace or through brokers or private deals. . That makes them more accessible and once they get wrapped onto defi, of course anyone could probably get them, but it doesn‚Äôt change the laws around securities offerings in the US and the need for accredited, investors, etc. That‚Äôs likely why they‚Äôre not available here on RH. . $PSIG fk Robinhood, never forget the company was founded on a lie to its customers to do the opposite of its namesake and rip them off for the founders hedge fund Buddy.  So don‚Äôt use it. But there are other tokenizations services."
"this is just tokens - if you want to own actual spacex you can do that via $ARKB Venture fund, I believe you can buy it in the $SOFI app. But this isn't available for me as a Norwegian. So I guess this is the next best shot"
Elon just threatened the entire Republican party lol.. $TSLA so dead.
$TSLA could open sub $300 tomorrow
$GOOGL is going to pretend the tweet was about it and dump 2% by open.

"Elon Musk knew, long before he so strongly Endorsed me for President, that I was strongly against the EV Mandate. It is ridiculous, and was always a major part of my campaign. Electric cars are fine, but not everyone should be forced to own one. Elon may get more subsidy than any human being in history, by far, and without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a $FBIN. Perhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!!. Holy shit the man has spoken ‚Äî $TSLA to $200"
Keepin‚Äô this full port on $TSLA calls going to fucking zero
$HOOD joins $PLTR as a stock i couldve bought at 20 and 5x my port but chose not to because I am a dumbass
$TSLA bers ‚ù§Ô∏è Elon's tweets.
1st it's your $TSLA calls dead. Then your SPY calls. 4th of July is going to be fun
Reading comments from $TSLA bagholders will be fun for the coming time being. LMAO
"lmao, Taco slept through a scheduled call, and now blames $T-PC and it's CEO for not getting the call connected.. Puts on $T"
$TSLA $310 tomorrow then sub $300 on Wednesday

$HOOD is at least a 100B company after today's announcement. Any shares below 100 is a buy.. Mark my comment and come back in a week to FOMO regards
$TSLA is below it's 200d sma now üíÄüíÄ

$GOOGL seriously wtf
Imagine being a large institutional holder of $TSLA and watching Elon tweet your clients pensions away. Lol...its actually funny if it wasn't so sad

$TSLA doesnt drop or go up on any actual news just based on Elon's behaviour on twitter.....stock is such a meme it makes gamestore look like value investing.
Bought more $HOOD calls at 3:58 pm. My dopamine receptors are fried at this point

i can GUARANTEE that one of these will moon by EOW: either $TSLA or TSLI
Everyone is right about $GOOGL for making most money except it‚Äôs always PUTS that print instead of CALLS.
I've been waiting for $HOOD $50 lol
$AAPL just felt right and moments later... Kept 5 just to see what happens this week 
"Not claiming to be a trading expert, but this $BBAI $5 call expiring July 25th has been on fire the past two weeks. Volume‚Äôs been heavy daily, and the momentum just keeps rolling‚Äîtoday it‚Äôs up 110%, with a +$10.5K gain and the stock at $6.93. Open interest is strong, IV is rocking at 145%, and delta‚Äôs sitting at 0.92.. This is my trade, my decision‚Äînot financial advice. I‚Äôm just putting it out there in case someone‚Äôs looking for ideas. I don‚Äôt recommend copying me, but I truly believe that long-term investing in strong plays like this can pay off big time.. Check the chart, read the news‚Äîsee the momentum for yourself."
"Budget bill passed. More money, allotted to military and homeland security. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if $BBAI announces more contracts with the government. . From my research, this company‚Äôs revenue has been steady, they‚Äôve spent a lot on merger and acquisition last year and R&D, and they have a back log on their services.  . this company‚Äôs technology, could be especially useful for security/biometrics during the World Cup. .

might as well short $CRCL
COIN has bounced off of the previous ATH several times lately. That‚Äôs strong support now. It‚Äôs in a possible bullflag and compressing after a huge move. We‚Äôre risk on and crypto stocks do well in this environment. Short $GLD or TSLa for a week or two if you need to get your bear rocks off or something.
ooh so close. If you had just added AI at the end you'd be up 43% this week.. $BBAI
Let‚Äôs goooo $BB !!
You got lucky $AAPL gapped spy up on old news. Otherwise my spread would've expired worthless.
YOLO on $HOOD
"Why is he getting flack for buying calls on a 10% ATH day? You guys have amnesia or something? $AMD, $CRCL, $CRWV and $ASTS ring a bell recently?! Those stocks ran days on days on days. $HOOD can easily do the same"
"Yeah I‚Äôm think 100 by eow, but problem is a WSB regard just bought calls at all time high, laws of the universe says this must go down. I need someone to make a bigger yolo on $HOOD puts to cancel it out."
"Thanks $ASTS, will wait for the potential dip in the next couple weeks when you probably announce you‚Äôre delaying launching satellites **for the 3rd/4th time** to probably jump back inüí∞ü•¥ü§ë"
$HOOD is. They're looking for regard translators
"Yeah, welcome to the club. I‚Äôve been locked in these $HOOD puts since May, doubling down every other week thinking there might be a dip in the near horizon or some shit. I‚Äôm currently down 48% as of today"
"Broke my risk management and maximum allocation rules for the 1st time to YOLO on BULL.. Position shot is from 6/25  . This risk was predicated on the redemption deadline of $BULLZ (6/30).  . I took the position that, given the crazy IV's on BULL calls, $BULLZ warrants were largely being used as cheap short-cover and that the redemption deadline was likely causing dilution fears.. Ironically, Webull nearly doubled the maintenance requirement on their own stock after the close last Friday (6/27). So I was forced to sell 1,050 shares before the close today. Still holding 5,500 shares.. "
$HOOD 2.0 or is gonna be like AMC/GME
Problem is no one knows when $NVDA will go down. Pure luck if you are trying to time
Hold on to this through September. I think we'll see $NVDA return to the 120s.

"To get bullish with $IREN, all one has to do is take a view on monetization of energy & land portfolio. Time to power is one of the most important pieces of the story. If the hyperscalars have 3 years to get to GW scale they can build their own energy. Oracle searching for 5 1GW+ sites ready in early 2026 - who else has this? $IGR new update yesterday shows data center rents are very strong. Mining Business. ~650M, 550M, 450M, 300M . If bitcoin does well or network difficulty stays constrained this can be much higher. If AI takes as much energy as people estimate, mining will only be done in markets with extreme power oversupply. Cumulative cash flows = 2B ($9 per share undiscounted) though all of this will be reinvested . Horizon 1 & 2 . 125M EBITDA ($1.25M/MW) -. valued at $12M/MW (100 MW IT load, 150MW gross) = 1.2B value ($5.5/shr) . Cloud Service. 30M EBITDA * 8x = ~$1/shr value. $IREN has 47MW with redundancy, great latency in Canada ready for conversion. If someone is willing to sign 2-4 year leases they will get GPU financing. . Assume they do convert it, 1B of financing, lease for $3/HR (cheap, $CRWV rents for $8.5) over whole 3-year chip life, 90% utilization (much higher now) - 3-4% of rev energy cost = 190M EBT * 10 = 1.9B value ($8.5/shr). Debt. 820M convertible notes at 3.25% interest rate (27M yearly) = -3.6$/shr. Corporate Overhead . 150M * 10 = 1.5B = -$6.5/shr. - currently subtracted from bitcoin cash flows but will double count for conservatism and dilution risk. Sweetwater 1.4GW April 26. Sweetwater 600MW Mid 27 . Bitcoin Mining Childress 600MW. Remaining Bitcoin Canada 110MW. Pipeline 1GW (2GW+ but assume they only get one) . Estimated Present Value = $1M/MW = 3.7B = $16/SHR. Potential Value if Monetized in a Time-To-Power Advantage Based on Precedent Transactions = $6M-12M/MW = 22.25B to 44.5B = $98-$196/SHR. If some of these were used for cloud, value creation would be higher, so no use distinguishing . Horizon illustrates the value capture clearly, costs 350M yet will deliver 60M-75M EBITDA valued at 15-20x, or 900M-1.5B, thus captures 7.3M-20M/MW in value. Even at 750k/MW on 1.92M/MW data center revenue ($160/kw/mo 2024 avg. rent, Cushman & Wakefield) you get valued at 15M/MW on a 7M cost, creating 8M/MW of value. At extremely low multiple for data center of 15 x 750k/MW = 11.25M/MW, capturing 4.25M/MW or 16B across the portfolio = $70/SHR. What initially gave me conviction - comparing 3.5 cents / kwh vs 6 cents for natural gas, >10 cents for nuclear, saves 220-570k/MW/yr. Capitalizing that along with other costs at 15x gives 3.3M-8.5M/MW value from energy savings alone. Then potentially couple M/MW from time savings, latency advantage, land value, power infrastructure, grid connected secured energy . SOP Target = $21/SHR. Mining Cash Flows $9. Current Infra Value $16 . Horizon I & II $5.5. Cloud $1 . Corporate Overhead ($6) . Debt ($3.5) . Horizon II Funding ($1) . Bull Case SOP = $84-$210/SHR. Potential Cloud $8.5 . Potential AI DC $70-$98-$196 . Risks - AI slowdown, data center oversupply, bitcoin crashes >40%. $CORZ $SCND $COMP. This is cruder, but the point stands even if my assumptions are way off. $CORZ potentially acquired by $CRWV  . 1.3GW secured power, 500MW AI DC under construction with $CRWV lease worth 7.5B (15M/MW) minus lease financing of 5B = 2.5B value . $CORZ speculative acq. EV = 6B. $CORZ mining = 18EH (200M EBITDA * 3x) = 600M value. $CORZ EV ex AI DC = 3.5B. $CORZ EV ex $BTC & AI = 2.9B. Implied value per secured MW = $3.625M/MW . $IREN has 3GW secured, though only 150MW AI under construction, worth maybe 1.875B (12M/MW, 20% less than $CORZ) minus remaining funding req of 125M = 1.75B . $IREN EV = 3.75B . $IREN mining = 51 $EH (650M EBITDA * 3x) = 1.95B. $IREN EV ex AI DC = 2B . $IREN EV ex $BTC & AI = 200M . Implied value per secured MW = 72k/MW . Being conservative and assigning a 2x multiple to mining = 460M = 160k/MW. Data Centers in 2025:. Bloom Energy 2025 Datacenter Report: Mid-Year Pulse. Executive Context: Power Is Now the Bottleneck. AI‚Äôs exponential growth is colliding with a fundamental constraint: electricity. . .By 2028, U.S. data centers are expected to consume 12% of the nation‚Äôs electricity‚Äîup from just 4% in 2023.. .Some hyperscale campuses are projected to demand over 1 GW, equivalent to powering 800,000 homes.. .This new reality is shifting power availability from a ""consideration"" to a strategic constraint that can determine the success or failure of a data center buildout.. 1. Power Access Has Surpassed All Other Site Criteria. .84% of developers now rank power availability among their top three considerations, far surpassing fiber proximity, regulations, and labor access.. .A year ago, fiber was the top concern‚Äîthis shift underscores how pressing the power situation has become.. 2. Power Delays Are Widely Underestimated. .Data center developers are underestimating grid connection timelines by 1‚Äì2 years.. .For example, in high-demand markets like Northern Virginia and Phoenix, developers think they can get power by 2026‚Äì2027, while utilities are forecasting 2028 or later.. .This gap reveals a growing disconnect and puts urgency on alternative solutions like onsite generation.. 3. AI Adoption Is Driving a Massive Scale-Up in Power Needs. .The median AI data center size is projected to grow:. .From ~175 MW today. .To ~275 MW by 2030. .To ~375 MW by 2035. .Much of this growth is tied to high-power chips like $NVDA Blackwell (~1kW per GPU).. .Many facilities will also merge training and inference workloads, further compounding the energy demand.. .There's also a significant shift to DC (direct current) architectures, borrowed from EV battery systems, to better manage the power flow for water-cooled racks and high-density servers.. 4. Onsite Power Is the Next Frontier. .Use of onsite power generation is expected to triple by 2030:. .38% of facilities will incorporate onsite generation (vs. 13% a year ago).. .27% expect to be fully powered onsite by 2030 (up from just 1%).. Reasons include:. .Faster deployment (vs. waiting on grid expansion). .Control over reliability. .Load flexibility for AI workloads. .However, air permitting could become a key hurdle‚Äîespecially in ‚Äúnon-attainment zones‚Äù with strict emissions rules. This is why low-emission fuel cell tech (like Bloom‚Äôs) is gaining favor.. 5. Reliability, Cost, and Load Flexibility Rule. .Reliability is the #1 requirement‚Äînon-negotiable.. .Cost matters, but only when paired with acceleration in time-to-power.. .Load following is now essential: AI models generate highly variable power demands, and older tech like turbines may not respond fast enough without compromising performance or emissions.. .Despite the focus on speed and cost, 95% of respondents still have carbon reduction goals, even if they‚Äôre deprioritized in the short term.. - Strategic Takeaway: Onsite Power as a Competitive Lever. .Onsite generation is no longer a Plan B‚Äîit‚Äôs a strategic enabler.. .The winners in this space will:. .Build faster by avoiding grid bottlenecks. .Maintain uptime with reliable onsite solutions. .Use scalable, flexible, and clean technologies (fuel cells, etc.). .Plan around permitting risks with low-emissions tech.

$IREN Play and why it has more room to run
This is to 2025 what $ASTS and $RKLB were in 2024. What do you see it at by end of year?
Hey /u/Gentleman-Dreamer -  I am a bot from /r/wallstreetbets.                                You submitted one or more banned tickers: $MMMW.. We don't allow discussion of low market cap (less than 500mm) tickers to prevent pump & dump spam and scammers.
I like $IREN
"We like the stock, however, we like $CLSK (pure-play $BTC miner) even more."
$IREN.. past tense. Similar sounding to Iran. Bearish.
"And their new convertible note holders need to get the stock price over $20 or they lose the rights to convert which makes the convertible notes a very poor investment, and their convertible note holders are very wealthy entities.  I am still lobbying them for the $BTC Dividend and they told me it is ""under consideration"" I told them they need to do a bit better than that."
Reek $OSCR 27k yolo
I swear to god $UNH if you blue balls me and crash at 310 again I‚Äôm gonna fuckin lose it
$NVDA is at 159 and the casino is not even open. You have to be kidding me ü´©
"This is why you don‚Äôt be an idiot and listen to bers, they had us thinking $NVDA was going to the 60s in April . Dumbest bull makes more than the smartest ber"
She's a 10 but she's bearish on $GOOGL because sEaRcH iS cOoKeD
SPY up $2. $GOOGL in the green. What a wonderful Sunday night
$GOOGL heading to 200
"$UNH about to pump until earnings. after that, who knows"
$GOOGL calls and TESLLER puts?
$CLBR WOOOOOOOO
"Declining sales, elon mental health in decline, battered by tariffs, no FSD or signs that they're anywhere close...... $TSLA to 1000!"
"$PLTR will be used to find these dudes in the Idaho mountains, yes?. $PLTR to $200 this week?"
$GOOGL
Should I buy $HOOD shares?
$NVDA 4T first
$NVDA going to 200 by August
weekly reminder $CRWD  makes new ATH every week since August.
"$AMD, Sofi and maybe $PLTR"
"Imagine not loading up on $MSTR calls when the top is about to blow off, we‚Äôre heading anywhere from 1500-4000 by EOY"
Looking to short $CRCL. Especially if rate cut happens in July. IV is through the roof right now so I‚Äôm just going to watch it for a bit.
"Fuck, $RKLB, I just need you to go up another 700%"
"Here's one trade to keep an eye out for tomorrow. $AMZN had a very bullish day with very high relative volume on Friday. It will open with a gap up most likely, but it might sell off to fill the overnight gap.. Look for $AMZN to go back and retest Friday's high - 223.25. If the retest is successful, go calls."
Woah wtf happened over at $NKE boys
Bro if $RKLB breaks 40 without me I will jump out my window
$TSLA 5 straight red days while Nasdaq breaks all time highs
$CLBR going starting the pump tomorrow
When is $NVDA gonna drop
$BBAI up 50% this week. Boner time
$GOOGL you open at 182 I‚Äôll be a happy degen
My dopamine juiced brain wants 300 $TSLA puts
So what exactly happened to $PLTR on Friday? Why‚Äôd it drop $10 in the last 10 minutes??. Im still grieving and trying to understand what the fuck happened to this stock that managed to take my port from 150k to 13k
"$BULL warrants expiring tomorrow. So, buying more calls and stocks"
Its $CLBR time this week!
I can't believe I sold $RKLB at 33. Someone end me.
Last chance to board the $CLBR train guys
Canada literally gulping DJT to the $BASE of his shaft.. Remember the taco memes? Remember when idiots thought trump didnt have pull?. Literally working other nations like a sock puppet  hahah
$NVDA could end the week under $100 and it wouldn‚Äôt even be 1/3 as Gay as Mods
What is in store for $CRCL this week bros?
$AMZN calls
"Goog, Amzn and $UNH calls"
Is $GOOGL a good short term play? Gonna be selling my $PLTR stuff tomorrow trying to figure out what to rotate into
"Dude $NVDA $159 in overnight, looks like $160+ tmrw, institutional fomo"
$CRCL already drilling looooool
Last change $NVDA under 160
Do you think $MU will get close to it's 155 target price ?
If $CRCL die it will make me a very happy man
ever notice any day that $TSLA has more volume than normal its always red
How can u be bear on $BULL
"I think jphy launching their $2 billion ETF last week and europe was where the money came from..the russell was leading all indexes last week.. Today, Cleveland cliffs is closing 6 mills..US steel has closed one down near st Louis. The two main iron ore mines in Minnesota are down. Trump's attempt to save the steel industry is failing so far. Steel did jump up to $950 and fell back down because of tariffs. But no one is buying. Cliffs shutting down pretty much all its operations says a lot.. The big beautiful bill is going to be nasty. It is cutting Medicare and Medicare to working age people. That will hit the medical field..plus, debt topped $37 trillion. Add $4 more if Trump gets his deal..dollar is crapping. Gold is in record territory.¬†. Trump has also slashed funding for food banks and made getting snap benefits nearly impossible. This will hurt grocery stores and cause food inflation to hit..plus, increased theft from people starving to death from no food banks or food stamps to eat on..the food bank I volunteer at is shutting down July 31.. Trump also seems to be targeting Democratic states to cut funding. I live in Illinois and all kinds of programs are shutting down. Npr, libraries, food banks, summer meals for kids, day care, etc.. regardless of your views, that's money no longer making it's way to main street.¬†. Trump keeps talking tax cuts. But the tax cuts are already in place. It's nothing new. He's bragging on $5.1 trillion in new FDI but whining about Powell keeping the interest rates high..I think Trump is trying to fast talk the world into doing what he wants like he did to build trump towers..with no real pieces in place, he needs the fed to lend before everything falls apart..plus, he keeps saying he made a deal with China when it's the same deal..tech for rare earths.. yet, Ford shut down their factory in Chicago over not having magnets from China..why would Trump need to get 3 of the same deals with China ? I still haven't seen anyone sign anything in a ceremony. What happened to the 60 countries blowing up lutnicks phone to make a deal in April ??. BRICS nations are up to 40 countries now. India, China being Trump's top 2 to get a trade deal with. But, Saudi Arabia joined the BRICS too. That means they jumped ship on only accepting us dollars for their oil..they are accepting local currencies now. I'm pretty sure that's why the money is heading to Europe. Everyone knows usa debt and lack of use as a global currency is gonna be a huge currency drop in value as soon as everyone figures it out..Bitcoin may shoot up to 1/4 million from just the US dollar realizing it's debt.. Then comes this quantum computing thing...do you know what happens to chip stocks if quantum computers replaces classic computers ? You'll see Nvidia pull an Enron in a flash if $GOOGL or qubt really has mastered quantum computers. NASA and Tesla is testing qubt as we speak. I think ai is overplayed right now. It will grow more later as things develop. But, everyone has an AI program now..grok, chatgpt, deepthink, palantir, Nvidia, etc. no one is a leader on AI anymore. It's common..but these quantum computers are going to be like going from a horse and buggy to a model t. Nvidia might get left behind and everyone buying their data centers might be sitting on worthless technology in a few years. That might be why the entire Nvidia board of directors is dumping stock right now..Huang even said it's moving faster than he originally said... I think things are a lot more uncertain than Trump and his team are saying..Trump has bullied the media into silence. So no one is testing what he says anymore. He surrounded himself with yes men journalist and no one is able to challenge him or karoline leavitt. He keeps promising the moon, but I don't see anything happening other than fighting Israel and Saudi Arabian war and a downturn in organic trade...oh, and 23,000 trucking companies have gone bankrupt this year. Freight prices are so low, owner operators are running at less than break even prices trying to stay in business...corn is down to $3 a bushel from Brazil. It's recession in every industry but chips and banks right now...unemployment is gonna hit after summer..restaurants are showing discretionary spending... And government economic reports are being falsified...Jerome Powell said he doesn't trust them anymore. Bottom line: tru.p is bullshitting and the real economy is shrinking..q1 GDP was minus .5%..."
UHHH $GOOGL IM GONNA CUM üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶üí¶

$MU to the moon plz
"Its me, bought $GOOGL friday at the open ü§ö"

"Will my $PLTR calls from Friday print :,("
$RIVN going to 16$ tomorrow mark my words. Bols Eat Bers.
can‚Äôt wait to see if my $RKLB calls recover
They told me selling puts you can make money. Casually sold some $RCAT puts. Got rekt thanks to liberation day. . Apparently you can sell before expiration date. I didn‚Äôt even know that shit. Also there is some stop loss even for options? Jesus why does no one tell me these things.. Someone desperately also assigned me their 39 contact shares (weird) and had to sell that for 48% loss. . Schwab has been sending me emails to join a training seminar. I‚Äôm planning to attend so that I can make back this lost monies. 
"Shoulda done $GOOGL, or maybe learn what you r doing"
Just buy $NVDA and hold for a decade thank me later.
Swinging calls is a gamble either way I sold my $GOOGL calls before close
Boys . How we feelin about $GOOGL at market open? I have 172 calls exp 7/3
$GOOGL calls + $PLTR puts = chef‚Äôs kiss.
How did you know $PLTR would dip hard before close? Suspicious
I also bought $PLTR at 143 calls at 64 bucks 2 of them exp is 7/03
$PLTR rebounding tomorrow and your puts are cooked unless you sell at open
"Bought $GOOGL calls, $PLTR puts, now I just pray to the market gods"
$PLTR down 9% and this man printed 791%? Bears eating good this week.
Why you didn‚Äôt tell us $PLTR was going to shut the bed like that I was watching and when I finally saw it I was done for the day my eyes were wide . I‚Äôm for sure snitching on you after this nap
$BBAI..
"I think companies like Upstart, $SOFI, etc that are highly rate sensitive. . Will probably also see a lot of activity in the market funding frontier tech companies because debt gets cheaper and the risk free rate drops."
"Buy your favourite home builder, mortgage company and real estate broker. You will notice they are low with rates st their highest in the cycle. I will be buying $COMP calls in size.. You can also short your most hated health insurer as the income they make from fixed income investments will be lower as bond yields fall.. Buying IWM calls is not the one. If rates fall 0.5% (look at Fed Funds rate vs 1 yr treasuries, it‚Äôs priced in somewhat) small businesses are not going to immediately hire more staff or make more revenue but the housing market will indeed be unlocked and transactions will flow again if mortgage rates can come down 0.5%-1%."
Calls on $RKT
$CVNA (dumping all those subprime loans)
$MI
$TREE.... Look what happened in last 5 years when rates went down.
$RDDT
$COMM is what you want
"Good small-cap with the potential to run during ai bubble...$SYM, have a look at the chart"
Sell the $CRCL . IPO hype is done imo . 2000+ trailing PE
I see $HOOD and $HIMS treated you well
Sell the $CRCL and buy $RBC
Needs more $NBIS
I‚Äôm sure $HOOD saved him or help a hell of a lot.  I sold before the crash and didn‚Äôt buy back dump move and I made 65k on hood and I didn‚Äôt have as many shares. Now I don‚Äôt know when he bought or his average
lol... It looks like my portfolio but instead with $RR. . Altough I have funds and other stuff to diversify in a separate broker... altough still my $RR shares are a big size of my investments... I should diversify more but it keeps going up and I feel like I would lose gains...maybe if I reach ever you 200% or so... ü§£
$UNH and $AAPL leaps now are literally free money
Margin interest on RH is high for the slow growth of $UNH back to peak.
"$UNH is about to crack $330, the momentum is building"
F $UNH. God bless Louigi.
Usually I don't participate in these talk me out of it posts. $UNH is below DCF models. It has crashed so it won't be primed for another.
Out with $UNH in with HIT
"Sir, you've had enough to drink. Go home and sleep it off.. $UNH is not a sure recovery. Their stock was propped up with 80b a year of waste and fraud in medicare.. And who's slashing medicare spending? The GOP.. I'm sure you can find something less risky to lose all your money on."
"Damn, the only calls you got is $AAPL"
Call on $AAPL but Put on SPY! What is that?
Something tells me by the way you type you‚Äôre a rich mofo and all this shit is Pennies to you . Anyway I also hit a similar high on April 4-8 and lost a good chunk but thank god I took some gains and put it into bull positions such as $HOOD and didn‚Äôt crash -80%
$AAPL calls and SPY puts‚Ä¶ help me understand.
That's one risky $ASTS put there.
"I'm new and make 6k in 3 months and lost it doing options and am now starting over. . You're handling this really well. Im glad you're not suicidal and all that. I've seen that so many times. The market taught me what I read. I did one Tesla trade and was up 2k, and, yeah. Now, I refuse to trade them until I learn charts better and start with the smaller stocks like $BBAI. I hope you're able to make it all back again one day."
"As someone who did the same amount in about the same time... 1. Your life is not money, 2. Your family needs the truth, 3. learn the lesson and don't look for another high to fill the gap, 4. find peace with you before moving on to something new, 5. NO ONE MADE THE $CHH BUT YOU AND THAT $CHH IS DEAD SO BURY IT AND MOVE ON!"
"Some experienced advice , just buy the stocks of its $AAPL , never buy options cause $AAPL is a nightmare for any hedge fund and the model you might be using for other stocks would never work for $AAPL."
. $150K -> $1.25m  thank you $RKLB
"Biggest win has been just holding onto 2000 shares of $ASTS and 10000 shares of $RKLB I bought last August. I know some people here think you have to be actively trading to win, but some of my best years historically have been years of holding appreciating assets and not doing much else."
. Compliments to $NVDA $RKLB and $ASTS
"Sold 1,065 shares of $PLTR at $16.45 and I‚Äôm still black and blue."
. $LUNR blew up my port when the lander crashed and Liberation Day saved it. Still slowly bleeding and had more fails on 0DTE than wins. Maybe I‚Äôll play the $CLBR lotto and lose the rest. Biggest Loss: $LUNR shares + calls heading into the moon landing. Biggest Win: SPY puts

$RKLB has killed it for me!

"Don't have a screenshot but my biggest loss of this year was shorting $CRCL $180C expiring 6/20...I received like $200 or something for opening it and capitulated at $6,200. $6K loss trying to grab a quick $200 lmao. and the worst part is that if it was expiring one week later, it expired worthless."

"First post on this sub and honestly most of Reddit. I have mainly been lurking for years but through my own individual research and 120+ total hours of daily (7 days a week) intense due diligence and research starting around May 21st, I stumbled into possibly one of the most enticing investment opportunities of the decade. Don't just read to the executive summary and try and poke holes. Read the whole thesis and at the very least, consider the ""investment committee"" rebuttals at the end. If you have done research into this field and have opinions to share or opposing research, please, let this be an open discussion!. Note: references to ""days of blackout"" or other timings are as of the afternoon of June 26, 2025.. Rating: **OVERWEIGHT** | Price Target: $120 (216% upside within 12 months) | Risk: **MEDIUM-HIGH**. **INVESTMENT $THSGF SUMMARY**. We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby $AAPL Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. Our analysis indicates this represents one of the most compelling asymmetric risk/reward opportunities in the current market, driven by simultaneous insider trading blackouts, regulatory catalysts, and Trump administration nuclear policy alignment.. Key Investment Highlights:. 	‚Ä¢	Regulatory Moat: NuScale remains the only $SMR with full Nuclear Regulatory Commission design certification. 	‚Ä¢	Political Tailwinds: Trump‚Äôs May 23 executive orders create explicit framework for hyperscaler nuclear partnerships. 	‚Ä¢	Corporate Necessity: Apple‚Äôs $500B AI infrastructure investment requires reliable baseload power. 	‚Ä¢	Timing Convergence: 44-day $AAPL insider blackout + 27-day NuScale blackout suggests imminent announcement. **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**. The convergence of corporate necessity (Apple‚Äôs AI energy demands), regulatory positioning (NuScale‚Äôs certification advantage), and political framework (Trump‚Äôs nuclear renaissance agenda) creates what we believe to be a generational investment opportunity. Our 30-day analysis reveals multiple validation points that have exponentially strengthened since thesis inception.. Base Case Scenario (70% probability): Apple-NuScale partnership announcement drives 200-300% appreciation. Bull Case Scenario (25% probability): Broader nuclear renaissance positioning drives 400-500% appreciation. Bear Case Scenario (5% probability): No partnership with any major player materializes, limited downside given current valuation ($20-$25/share). **CONVERGENCE ANALYSIS**. Corporate Strategic Alignment. Apple‚Äôs AI Infrastructure Imperative: The company‚Äôs February $500B investment commitment includes data center expansion across nine states, requiring significant baseload power. Unlike hyperscaler peers (Meta, Microsoft, Google) who have secured nuclear partnerships, $AAPL represents the largest unpartnered AI infrastructure player.. NuScale‚Äôs Competitive Positioning: As the only NRC-certified $SMR provider with manufacturing capabilities (12 modules in production via Doosan partnership), NuScale possesses an unassailable regulatory moat that becomes increasingly valuable as hyperscaler nuclear demand accelerates.. Political Economy Framework. Trump‚Äôs nuclear executive orders create unprecedented policy support for private-sector nuclear partnerships, particularly those supporting AI infrastructure. The administration‚Äôs goal of 400 GW nuclear capacity by 2050 requires massive private investment, making high-profile corporate partnerships politically essential for demonstrating market viability.. Insider Trading Pattern Analysis. The simultaneous 44-day $AAPL blackout (unprecedented duration) and 27-day NuScale blackout (beginning immediately post-Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval) represents statistically anomalous corporate behavior consistent with major strategic transaction negotiations.. **FINANCIAL MODELING & VALUATION**. Revenue Impact Analysis. 	‚Ä¢	Single $AAPL Partnership: $2-5B annual contract value over 20 years. 	‚Ä¢	Market Validation Effect: Additional hyperscaler partnerships following $AAPL announcement. 	‚Ä¢	Manufacturing Scale: Doosan partnership capable of 20+ modules annually (as of deal signing in 2023). Ownership Structure Validation (from 2024 10-K). 	‚Ä¢	Fluor Corporation (47%): Military-industrial complex alignment provides execution credibility. 	‚Ä¢	Japan NuScale Innovation (7%): International strategic validation. 	‚Ä¢	Management Quality: CEO John Hopkins‚Äô U.S. Chamber of Commerce positioning demonstrates policy navigation capabilities. **RISK/REWARD ASSESSMENT**. Asymmetric Setup Characteristics. 	‚Ä¢	Multiple Success Pathways: Partnership, acquisition, or broader nuclear adoption all drive appreciation. 	‚Ä¢	Limited Downside: Current valuation reflects minimal nuclear renaissance expectations. 	‚Ä¢	Leveraged Exposure: $SMR sector concentration amplifies any positive catalysts. Catalyst Timeline. 	‚Ä¢	Immediate (1-45 days): Partnership announcement probability. 	‚Ä¢	Medium-term (2-12 months): Nuclear renaissance policy implementation. 	‚Ä¢	Long-term (2-5 years): Commercial deployment and revenue generation. **INVESTMENT COMMITTEE Q&A**. Q: Dependency on corporate execution - what if Apple/NuScale partnership doesn‚Äôt materialize?. Response: This concern misunderstands the anthropological drivers at play. Tim Cook‚Äôs psychology operates on legacy positioning - he will not allow $AAPL to fall behind in the infrastructure arms race that defines AI leadership. Hopkins, as a Chamber of Commerce-embedded operator, understands that first-mover partnerships with $AAPL create market validation that benefits NuScale regardless of subsequent deal flow.. The convergence isn‚Äôt dependent on corporate whim - it‚Äôs driven by structural necessity. $AAPL needs nuclear, NuScale has the only certified solution, and Trump‚Äôs framework removes regulatory barriers. Even if this specific partnership fails, the thesis benefits from multiple pathways: government acquisition, other hyperscaler partnerships, or broader nuclear adoption all drive similar outcomes.. Q: Political risk - what if Trump‚Äôs priorities shift away from nuclear?. Response: Trump‚Äôs ego architecture makes nuclear reversal psychologically impossible. He‚Äôs publicly committed to ‚ÄúAmerican energy dominance‚Äù and 400 GW nuclear capacity - reversing course would contradict his core political identity. More importantly, Hopkins understands the political machine through his Chamber positioning. The nuclear renaissance isn‚Äôt just Trump policy - it‚Äôs bipartisan infrastructure necessity driven by AI competition with China.. Nuclear power represents Trump‚Äôs ability to simultaneously claim ‚ÄúAmerica First‚Äù energy independence and technological superiority. These are core psychological drivers that don‚Äôt shift with news cycles. The framework is locked in place by Trump‚Äôs legacy needs.. Q: Regulatory timing risk - Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval doesn‚Äôt guarantee deployment certainty. Response: This assumes static regulatory environment, which misreads the political moment. Trump‚Äôs executive orders explicitly direct agencies to expedite nuclear deployment and establish categorical NEPA exclusions. Hopkins‚Äô background suggests he‚Äôs positioned for regulatory navigation - not regulatory compliance gambling.. The May 29 Nuclear Regulatory Commission approval timing (immediately before insider blackouts) suggests coordination between regulatory completion and commercial announcement. This isn‚Äôt speculative - it‚Äôs orchestrated regulatory theater designed to create deployment certainty. The political framework eliminates traditional regulatory uncertainty.. Q: Market efficiency - if this is obvious, why isn‚Äôt it already priced in?. Response: Market efficiency assumes perfect information distribution, which fails with multi-dimensional convergence analysis. The pattern requires simultaneously tracking: insider trading behavior, regulatory timelines, political anthropology, and corporate strategic necessities. Most analysts operate in single-factor frameworks.. Additionally, the 30-day research depth required to identify this convergence exceeds typical institutional attention spans. Market makers have micro-timing advantages but lack macro-convergence pattern recognition. The information is public, but the interpretive sophistication required creates genuine asymmetry.. The psychological timing also matters - announcing before July 4 maximizes political impact while minimizing opposition organization time. This level of strategic timing analysis exceeds normal market efficiency assumptions.. This convergence represents genuine analytical edge, not market inefficiency exploitation.. RECOMMENDATION. OVERWEIGHT rating with 3-5% portfolio allocation for aggressive growth mandates. The combination of regulatory positioning, political tailwinds, and corporate necessity creates exceptional asymmetric opportunity with institutional-quality risk management potential.. Price Target: $120 (12-month horizon). Catalyst Timeline: 1-45 days for initial validation. Analyst: (redacted) | Publication Date: June 26, 2025. ***TECHNICAL ANALYSIS VALIDATION/CONVERGENCE***. Ascending Triangle Formation. The target security exhibits a textbook ascending triangle pattern with compelling technical characteristics that independently validate our fundamental catalyst timeline.. Pattern Structure:. 	‚Ä¢	Horizontal resistance: Consistent rejection at $45.31 level over multiple tests since early June. 	‚Ä¢	Rising support trendline: Higher lows pattern from $29.45 base indicating systematic accumulation behavior. 	‚Ä¢	Volume compression: Decreasing volatility range suggesting institutional positioning ahead of known catalyst. 	‚Ä¢	Apex convergence: Pattern completion anticipated within 3-6 trading days. Institutional Significance:. The ascending triangle represents more than technical pattern recognition - it demonstrates institutional anticipation of our identified catalyst events. The rising support trendline indicates smart money accumulation at progressively higher prices, suggesting advance knowledge of pending announcements. Volume analysis reveals institutional-size block trading concentrated at key support levels, consistent with strategic positioning rather than retail speculation.. Catalyst Alignment Validation:. The technical pattern convergence timing provides independent confirmation of our fundamental analysis. The 3-6 day apex timing aligns precisely with:. 	‚Ä¢	Trump‚Äôs July 4th symbolic opportunity window. 	‚Ä¢	Apple‚Äôs 44-day insider blackout approaching natural conclusion. 	‚Ä¢	Political necessity for immediate manufacturing narrative wins. This convergence represents what technical analysts call ‚Äúsmart money confirmation‚Äù - when institutional behavior validates fundamental thesis timing through observable market mechanics.. Breakout Probability Assessment:. Ascending triangles historically resolve upward in 70-80% of cases, with breakout magnitude typically correlating to pattern duration and volume compression intensity. The current formation demonstrates:. 	‚Ä¢	4-week consolidation period: Extended enough to absorb selling pressure. 	‚Ä¢	Multiple resistance tests: Each rejection followed by higher low formation. 	‚Ä¢	Volume contraction: Institutional accumulation without retail distribution. Price Target Methodology:. Technical analysis provides multiple target frameworks:. 	‚Ä¢	Initial breakout objective: $60+ (33% above $45.31 resistance, representing gap-fill to prior highs). 	‚Ä¢	Measured move calculation: $75-85 (pattern height of ~$16 projected from breakout point). 	‚Ä¢	Fundamental convergence target: $120 (enterprise value analysis of strategic partnership implications). The technical setup suggests the initial breakout could reach $60-65 within days of catalyst announcement, with fundamental revaluation driving appreciation toward the $120 enterprise value target over subsequent quarters.. Information Asymmetry Evidence:. Perhaps most significantly, the ascending triangle formation demonstrates market anticipation of our identified catalysts. The pattern suggests institutional players possess advance knowledge of pending announcements, creating the exact information asymmetry that generates exceptional investment returns. The technical behavior validates our insider blackout analysis and political timing thesis through independent market confirmation.. This technical validation transforms our fundamental analysis from theoretical possibility into market-confirmed probability, with institutional positioning behavior providing real-time verification of our catalyst timeline accuracy.‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã. A few of my sources: *feel free to inquire on others*. DISCLAIMER:.

"> We identify a high-probability convergence scenario whereby $AAPL Inc. announces a strategic nuclear partnership with NuScale Power within the next 1-45 days. . who tf is ‚Äòwe‚Äô?.. Not intending to be mean here but you‚Äôre basing a lot on this $AAPL prediction. I hope it happens, and it‚Äôll pump if it does, but Nuscale is already pumped to the tits. Your AI generated ‚Äòthesis‚Äô basically says: if the $AAPL deal doesn‚Äôt happen, some other good thing will probably happen.. Like, what? . I have a position (shares) similar size to yours but I won‚Äôt buy any more over $20"
Priced in. If nothing materializes I expect $SMR to go down to 25 over the next few months
$OKLO. [. [. [. [
"Unitl this administration is still in charge, $SMR will always be below $OKLO. I did not see the CEO of $SMR in beside POTUS when he was signing executive orders on Nuclear energy. . $OKLO is the clear leader, you can argue all day about the permits and design. BUT don't miss the important part, the people behind it."
"Interesting.  Bought some $SMR a few weeks ago after I sold it 9 months ago.. Owned $OKLO, but they seem more of a VAR?"
"There was a recent Odd Lots podcast with Michael Cembalast (of JP Morgan) and at about the 47 minute mark the small modular reactor situation was addressed. His main points were:. 1. Despite many years of trying, nobody has actually built one in the USA and a couple built in China and Russia went way over budget (and both China and Russia should have cost advantages over the USA).. 2. The idea is seductive, but nuclear reactors are not something that can be commoditized like solar panels, batteries, and wind turbines (which all benefit from a learning curve that can dramatically reduce cost of production because millions or tens of millions of units are produced). Nuclear reactors remain capital intensive and capital intensive projects require scale for economics.. 3. Cembalast says the costs per MW at NuScale went from $3 million to $20 million and they still haven‚Äôt built one. . My personal aside is back in 1976-82 I was a nuclear reactor operator on a Navy Submarine. The Navy has a history of building small modular reactors for submarines and ships that stretches back to the 1950‚Äôs. SMRs are essential for submarines and the cost for the Navy is orders of magnitude higher than what the commercial vendors are promising. Physics has not changed. Everything I have ever read about from the small reactor supporters are old ideas which have been implemented experimentally in one way or another (not at scale, in experiments). I am very dubious about the commercial application of small reactors.. Also, as a personal aside, I don‚Äôt think $AAPL would touch this business with a 100ft pole. I‚Äôd bet anything that is a total chatGPT hallucination."
Thanks for fueling my $SMR hopium
ULTY just added $SMR on last weeks rebalance.
"$SMR was going to sell Utah a gigawatt of SMRs for $3B (2015.)  In 2023, when cost overruns and regulatory burdens similar to those Westinghouse experiences with its old school LNMRs drove the price to $9.3B for a 462MW install, and the forecasted operating electricity prices weren't competitive with fossil even after subsidies were factored in, Utah cancelled the project.. Tim Cook knows nothing about how to operate a nuke plant and certainly doesn't want the PR fallout from putting nuclear reactors in anyone's backyard.  And these SMRs are designed to be put in your backyard.  For that matter, Tim Cook doesn't seem to think AI matters yet.. So everything in this pitch is wrong and regarded.. Long $SMR"
"RYCEY is the way to go for $SMR.Already have expertise in nuclear power subs, and now backed by UK Govt and a Czech contract"
This is so dumb lmao.  Why would $AAPL announce a partnership with a company who hasn't even built a single plant yet.  I like nuclear stocks for sure but the $AAPL partnership is just schizo talk.
"Wait your analysis is that there weren‚Äôt any insider buys in these two companies for 30+ days so they must be collaborating? LMFAO!. For the past 5 years of insider buying I looked at with $AAPL, the buying tends to happen in feb, april, august, october. Probably something to do with fiscal year compensation. . Regardless, this is regarded."
All of these companies are riding the hype while the insiders sell. $OKLO cofounders sold $300M last week (transferring to a tax advantage trust) along with another board member selling 300k shares just last week too. Look at the non sense news they keep putting out. $OKLO talking about government contracts that were first reported years ago with no clear financials. CEO and CFO go around spouting nonsense. Up and running by Q4 2027-Q1 2028 is ridiculous. Even their own website is hype (look at the building). They think they can build a single reactor for $34M with initial fuel at $35M. Good luck with that let alone getting approval on the design. A fast neutron reactor with a sodium cooling system screams ‚ÄúBOOM‚Äù. . I believe there are only 2 of this type of reactor in the entire world and they‚Äôre both in the middle of nowhere in Russia. The safety specs alone needed will bleed this company dry. They‚Äôll be forced to dilute and dilute while putting out hype to fuck retail. $SMR has failed miserably as well but at least they have an approval. They found out just how expensive nuclear truly is and why it‚Äôs been such a challenge. . Then this guy slaps a crazy theory that $AAPL is going to pick a public company that has had massive amounts of complications in trying to get a reactor up. $AAPL doesn‚Äôt even have an Ai product themselves. $AAPL doesn‚Äôt believe Ai capex is worth it right now and to an extent I see where he‚Äôs coming from. Elon saying he‚Äôs spending $1B a month on XAi with negative cash generation seems insane. ChatGPT isn‚Äôt profitable and they‚Äôre the largest use case company. How are they going to make money? $AAPL is in sit back and wait mode. At least write your own shit.
"Where was bro around May 21, 2024 when $SMR was around $7?"
The constant hate from this sub on $HOOD was the reason why I amassed 620 shares at around $10 a share lmao
Gj man. $HOOD calls have been killing it this month. Close that shit and roll up
". I waited till 3 mins before close. $182.5 $GOOGL expiring 3rd July. I know I should‚Äôve hold it few more days, but today was a good day. Let‚Äôs see what happens over the weekend"
what is up with $GOOGL today!
"$GOOGL as expected, happened to me last Friday, Puts, I sold it syrocked lol"
"Same brother. $PEP got up to $2+ today. Sold another batch of 32 at $0.56 and eeked out a small gain overall, but I‚Äôd be rolling in it if I had balls.. "
"Similar with $CRCL, had 200p 6/27  up 9.30 on Wednesday sold them, then went to 1.90 on Thursday then today they were up 22.00. Gains are gains"
Yeah $GOOGL really fucked us today. Rallied like crazy in the final 5 minutes of the trading day.
$GOOGL is one stock I‚Äôll never trade options on. Only shares
The universe isn't against you. I always thought this too but I for some reason held my $GOOGL call. This doesn't happen to me usually.
I had the same thing happen with $TSLA puts. Frustrating but at least I took a profit.
Yet people kept telling $GOOGL was a bad investment last few months due to chatGPT.
"Don‚Äôt feel bad, I sold my $NKE calls before today‚Äôs rocket ship."
"EVERY TIME I INVEST. I INVEST IN $NVDA, DOWN FOR 6 MONTHS. NOW I INVEST IN ATD, IN ONLY 2 WEEKS, DOWN 8%. How many fuking months before ATD rebounds?"
And the dip is gone. Those $JPM AI bots cycling trades are killing it.
"If you talked shit, you better apologize. $NKE"
My $CLBR calls will save me from my Nike puts right.....Right?
"$630K in green and suddenly he‚Äôs the Messiah of $NKE. You were a degenerate gambler last week, now you‚Äôre Wall Street‚Äôs unwashed prophet..

OpenAI taps $GOOGL Cloud TPUs in bid to diversify AI chip supply
It‚Äôs incredible how people don‚Äôt see just how set up for AI domination $GOOGL is. . They‚Äôre literally the only company that can actually vertically integrate this shit.. Who else has data on 8B people and the literal Tower of Babel when it comes to video content to train their models
"I was thinking to myself that $GOOGL and $AMZN and $AAPL have had it rough the past month and are next to break ATHs. Maybe this is where it happens, my $GOOGL calls went from -10k to +3.4k in a week"
"Here we go, everyone trying to create Deepseek type FUD because OpenAi will use some $GOOGL TPUs for inference. You guys know $GOOGL buys a gigantic amount of GPUs from Nvidia right? . Nvidia is sold out on the order book through 2026. It's all committed. . $GOOGL will go up, Nvidia will keep going up. Nvidia is the kingmaker."
"Very bullish on $GOOGL but it has been doing nothing for months as the market went to ATH. It's been hard to rationalize buying more and holding while you see everything else hit ATH and it's still in the depths. Having said that this week looks like a turnaround, earnings are around the corner....it's undervalued relative to the market. I will remain bullish until there's a reason not to be."
"Great for $GOOGL, possibly catastrophic for $NVDA. My read of this is that OpenAI is moving towards alternatives to bleeding edge but very expensive Nvidia chips, especially considering the fact that they are using Alphabet‚Äôs older TPUs.. For $NVDA, this could absolutely blow up their ‚Äúselling shovels in a gold mine‚Äù narrative that has been keeping their valuation so high. Not saying it‚Äôs over for them but there will be a correction and they won‚Äôt have the same ludicrous growth they‚Äôve had these past couple of years."
I'm super long $GOOGL with a lot of shares. I fully believe $GOOGL will make my retirement comfy as shit
The mere rumor $GOOGL would consider selling its TPUs to outsiders would crash NVDA‚Ä¶
$GOOGL is going to be the first $10T company
"\> There is no moat, no pricing power, no differentiation. Competitors will squeeze Circle until there is nothing left, and customers will chase whoever gives them more yield..

"We're in 2025. P/E, $PEG, profitability... who cares? It's all about the flow and storytelling!"
"Banks issue stable coins. Stable coins become legit currency. . Hahahhahahahaha this world is delulu. . The only reason $BTC and other coins have value and there is money, is because of gambling and hoarding bets. Nothing viable, nothing stable, flawed network. . If Banks really adapt this. You are looking at a Dystopian society where classes and wealth is wiped out in software bugs. . Man if this Genius Act passed. Oh man the world is coming into sad sad times."
Think even Jamie Dimon might crack and $JPM will issue a stablecoin? I think they might be one of the only holdouts.
"I understand how they earn their money, I just don't understand why I the consumer would want to use it if I have no worries about fiat. I travel a lot and I have a Wise card that uses the $V network. I can keep whatever currency I want on my card. If I'm from Argentina and worry about devaluation of the currency I can transfer money to the wise card and keep it in USD, EUR or whatever. The cost of the transfer and exchange rates are minimal compared to the banks and I have the ability to spend my money with any merchant that accepts $V. I agree with you that I don't see a business model that justifies what is currently trading at but what do I know, tesla is a perfect example of market cap having nothing to do with reality for many years but eventually reality will make a house call and it will come down to earth. Thanks for the explanation"
Finally $SOFI Pays
A truely well played $LPTX.
honestly. I'm mega bullish on $SOFI. it's almost moving in tandem with $HOOD
"So, I am long on $AAPL based on the below possible Elliott Wave scenario. Just wanted to open this for discussion and get different point of views. I am not asking for advise, just want to hear from you guys. . How possible do you think the below scenario is to happen? Screenshots of the 1-hour and daily charts.. 1-hour chart:. Daily chart:. "
$AAPL Technical Scenario Discussion
Bro I've been holding 800 shares of $AAPL on MARGIN since it crashed to 183 months ago. I highly highly highly suspect alot of retail bought low too and market makers want us to tap out of patience or keep paying interest on margin used for the shares. The whole narrative on lack of AI innovation doesn't justify the share price being 20% below highs while sp500 sits at record highs. Im not selling until 230 atleast
$AAPL is a sleeping giant. It will randomly make a move when you least expect it.
"There is no technical for Tim $AAPL right now. Won't go up until they pay off the king. I think it will happen, but not for a few months."
"Last week, I thought a few of the Mag7 stocks were getting too lofty, and it was a good time to pick up some $AAPL. The scenario where $AAPL plays catch-up has played out a couple of times in recent years. I came across your thread over the weekend, and my reasoning was less technical than yours, but so far, you've made a good call!"
Guys if you don‚Äôt like what OP is doing you don‚Äôt have to participate. I like this chart. There was massive inflows into ITM July 18P yesterday. Could be someone expects it to recover to $225-$230 pretty quick. Also saw another chart (can‚Äôt find it) showing the last time $AAPL lagged the Mag7 it had a hell of a run to catch back up.. 
"$AAPL can‚Äôt figure out AI = $AAPL tanks below $100. Look at their growth rate for the last 5 years. If next year, $AAPL Intelligence is still dog shit, you will see a migration to Android like never before."
$GOOGL trade talks going well.
$GOOGL is trading at the same value as it was on 6/11. How did this call gain so much value?
Why the green dildo with $GOOGL
I kid you not I sold my $GOOGL calls not even 30 seconds before the 2% pump
So there‚Äôs obvious good news on $GOOGL for it to fucking move like a shit coin like that at the end but we don‚Äôt know
$GOOGL and $AMZN both ripped what was the news
Holy fuck $GOOGL what was that
Jesus.  That $GOOGL 3% rocket saved my week
$GOOGL pumping to ATH in 2 weeks guaranteed
$GOOGL and $AMZN have announced a merger preapproved by Trump.  New company will be called Gazillion.

I was up $15K this year then I played the $CVNA short game. Now I‚Äôm down $10K
"I've lost lots of money buying puts on these: $CVNA, $PLTR, $TSLA, $QUBT"

yikes. it might actually. keep a close eye on $ROOT on how those CVNA/ $ROOT warrants play out
Meanwhile $AAPL and $GOOGL are down 20%
"Why does the market always go up?. Because it‚Äôs not the same market. In 20 years the top 500 will look completely different . 20 years ago we had Sears, Blockbuster, Circuit City, Enron, Rite Aid, etc etc.   Now we have $NVDA, Pltr.. in 20 years it will be digital xyz and new drugs, and flying cars, and 3d printed food and houses etc."

"Brother it didn't stomp you out you paperhanded the hell out of this position. Obviously $CRCL was going to fall, you just had to be patient and numb yourself a bit."
Tbh it‚Äôs harder to bet against meme stocks than good stocks. The float is very tiny so day traders and MMs can manipulate it a lot. Value companies like $UNH will tank straight up on bad news and no one will try throwing money at ‚Äúoversold bounce‚Äù. This happens to a lot of newbies. Just give yourself longer expiration (2 mths out) and hold.

Why does this look like a $DDD ball
"but $NKE stock just pumped to $72, you sold a call so you bet that NKW will remain below $62. . so you are losing money on this call?"
"Clipped 30 $NVDA 150s into the IV ramp  $9.4K realized. Risk sold, theta paid Onto the next"
I should really flair this as a loss $GOOGL
Same thing happened with on $UNH calls back then. Missed out on 6k if i held 10 minutes longe
I love woke stocks! $NKE calls paid big
Yup made 10k on $NKE calls! Great Friday for us! Congrats.
"Dude, $NKE is anything but woke, they like literally use sweatshops to make their product... I know their adverts might be all inclusive, but hell, look at Coca Cola they hire people to beat folks with sticks for protesting Coca Cola robbing their water supply dry and selling it back to them in an addictive form. .

"In 2011-2012, as a college freshman, I almost put $2K into $NVDA because I thought their Project Shield would be popular, potentially a huge jump in portable gaming, akin to the steam deck or Switch. . Ended up buying weed and beer and going to music festivals. . I forget what that would be at this point, but last I checked it would be over 1m. . I try not to think about that."
". I'm shortly behind you. I didn't get to play with $NVDA, but the Bed, Bath, & Beyond play (a couple of years ago) really got me caught up."
"jesus, I remember looking at $NVDA in 2016 - I think pre-split it was like $16 a share. I invested an held $AMD instead. Decent return but nothing compare to $NVDA."

That is a consultant. Upgrade it significantly and you get firms like Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and the Kraft deal. I think they tied up the entire money supply of the US for that one for a short period of time. $KREF-PA knew how to make that deal happen. Others didn't. So they got paid a ton of cash to do it and they pulled it off. That's why we have consultants. toodles."

"This is the biggest question out there.. If tariffs are called off, Powell will cut because labor market is softening.  If tariffs are put back on, Powell won't cut, worried about inflation.  If it's pushed back, Powell won't cut, thinking the problem still isn't solved.. But Trump's ego vs his desire for lower interest rates, I'm not sure which one wins, but I'm kind of leaning on ego.  It's the one consistent thing in his whole life.  I don't think he's ever said sorry or appeared to back down personally.  I don't think he can put the blame on anyone else either without keeping tariffs hiked, which is his other constant play in life (blame someone else).. Maybe it's going to be ego + insider trading and let his friends know he's going to tank the market again.  I could believe that.. Honestly not sure on the play.  Puts are cheap now, so that could be a play.  Gold seems to have topped and is coming down.  Cash is always solid, but we could have an even faster meltup if there's no tariffs that you'll miss.. I don't think it's priced in, though.  If anything, what's priced in is the current state of the tariffs, like 10% on everyone, and all the other new tariffs, if that even.. My conviction play is $GOOGL.  Its PE is super low, and they've got all that sweet tech, especially Waymo, which is crushing it.  I doubt it'll go down more than the SPY.  Plus, limited exposure to tariffs on goods.  The more the dollar craters, the higher their income will be due to currency conversion from other places."

"Let me be a little more clear, since it seems no one noticed this‚Ä¶. $BBAI is mid-squeeze, and it wasn‚Äôt exactly subtle. I posted about it ~20 minutes ago and got hit with a couple of dismissive replies, but the signs were all there: huge volume, tight consolidation, loaded call $OI, and obvious short pressure. This wasn‚Äôt luck ‚Äî it was visible if you were looking.. I grabbed July 11 $5 calls at $0.50 this morning. They nearly tripled by close, and I more than doubled my position. Didn‚Äôt trim yet ‚Äî holding for that $1.50+ pop that could hit first thing tomorrow if this momentum keeps up.. Not saying this goes full meme, but if we see another volume surge and a clean move through $6, the next leg could be nasty (in a good way). Shorts aren‚Äôt out yet, and the float isn‚Äôt exactly huge. I‚Äôm ready to lock gains if it loses steam, but I like the risk/reward where I‚Äôm sitting right now.. Again, not pretending to be a market wizard. I‚Äôm just saying: this squeeze was obvious if you were paying attention ‚Äî and there still might be more gas in the tank.. TLDR: Up 100%+ on $BBAI calls, squeeze looks real, watching premarket for continuation. If this rips tomorrow, don‚Äôt act surprised."

"As of this post, $SANA is valued at $654M. I [previously posted some DD on $SANA ]( am now up over 50% on 37625 shares at the current price of $2.90. Here's why I believe $SANA can 15X or more from here to a price of at least \~$43 corresponding to a market cap of \~$10B minimum.. **Background**. $SANA has technology that they use to modify lab-grown cells so that the cells are not rejected (killed) when transplanted into a patient. The genetically modified cells are referred to as ""immune evasive"" cells. As a proof of concept, $SANA modified donor pancreatic islets (islets are cells that regulate blood sugar and produce insulin) so that the donor pancreatic islets would be immune evasive and could be implanted into a human recipient patient without being rejected. In type 1 diabetics, they are missing the cells that produce insulin, so replacement islets are a known cure for type 1 diabetes, but getting them to survive without immunosuppression has been an impossible task. One patient was implanted with immune evasive islets by $SANA on Dec. 2, 2024. The patient did not need to take immunosuppression after receiving the immune evasive donor pancreatic islets in order for the transplanted islets to survive (normally donor islets are rejected/killed within a couple weeks).. 6 month data from the Dec. 2 transplant was just released this past Monday (June 23, 2025) and revealed that the transplanted immune evasive pancreatic islet cells were still alive and functional (producing insulin), eliminating any doubt that $SANA'S tech will enable lab-grown cells to survive long-term in patients ([source]( This is the FIRST AND ONLY TIME that human IMMUNE EVASIVE CELLS have been transplanted and demonstrated to SURVIVE LONG TERM in a HUMAN. In other words, $SANA now owns unique technology that will be vital for not just enabling a type 1 diabetes cure (the survival of transplanted lab-grown pancreatic islets), but any therapy or cure that involves avoiding rejection while transplanting lab-grown cells or tissues into a patient.. It's worth noting that for type 1 diabetes in particular is an autoimmune disease, meaning the patient's own immune system kills off their insulin producing cells. For this reason, aside from rejection, immune evasion is essential to a type 1 diabetes cure just due to the nature of the disease. Genetically matched islets would still have their insulin producing cells killed off without immune evasive technology.. **What's next for $SANA? (transplanting immune evasive stem cell derived pancreatic islets)**. $SANA'S initial transplant study in 1 patient used pancreatic islets from a deceased donor. Obviously, this is not a scalable source of the pancreatic islets needed to cure type 1 diabetes. $SANA recognized this and has already produced pancreatic islets from stem cells that are immune evasive. They have a master stem cell line with the immune evasive edits (that is now very well characterized to avoid unwanted mutations) that they can use to grow as many pancreatic islets as they want in the lab from scratch. These are referred to as ""stem cell derived islets"". Scientists are very good at growing functional islets from stem cells in the lab now, so this is not a problem that $SANA has to worry about. The islets they can produce from their immune evasive stem cell line are functional enough to cure type 1 diabetes. A recent ongoing trial from another company, Vertex, demonstrated that stem cell derived islets can be used to cure type 1 diabetes ([source]( however, critically, Vertex has no solution for the rejection problem and the patients in their study had to take immunosuppressants to avoid rejecting the stem cell derived islets. 1 of the 14 initial patients in Vertex's study DIED due to being on the immunosuppressants (which severely weakens a patients immune system, making them vulnerable to simple infections). The patient died from a fungal infection known to affect people on immunosuppression and that people with healthy immune systems would have normally avoided ([source](. $SANA has now made immune evasive stem cell derived islets which are known to be functional enough to cure type 1 diabetes. Vertex's trial, which relied on deadly immunosuppression, confirms beyond any doubt that stem cell derived islets can cure type 1 diabetes. Considering $SANA'S recent 6 month data in the first human patient transplanted with immune evasive islets, it is now essentially known that $SANA'S immune evasive stem cell derived islets will last long term in patients without immunosuppression, since they use the same immune evasive tehcnology that worked in the first human patient. Thus, all that remains at this point is for $SANA to start human trials with their immune evasive stem cell derived islets. Sure, they have to go through the trials, but  the current evidence overwhelmingly indicates that $SANA'S immune evasive stem cell derived islets will be successful.. **Competition**. $SANA is light years ahead of any potential competition. They are the only company with demonstrably successful long-term immune evasive technology. There are 2 other companies, Vertex and $CRSP, that claim to be working on immune evasive pancreatic islets; however, none of these 2 companies have demonstrated long-term working immune evasive technology. Moreover, they won't simply be able to copy $SANA'S tech since it will violate their patents. In order to even compete with $SANA regarding immune evasive cells, Vertex and $CRSP have to come up with an alternative immune evasive technology that $SANA has not already patented and that demonstrably works in humans long-term. This is not a trivial feat. Both companies are severely behind $SANA. Both $CRSP and Vertex list their immune evasive islet therapies as ""research stage"" on their pipeline pages ([source Vertex]( [source CRISPR]( In other words, they have no real chance of catching up to $SANA any time soon, and they may never.. While Vertex has transplanted stem cell derived islets into humans that cure type 1 diabetes, as mentioned above, the patients needed to be on immunosuppressant drugs to avoid rejection of the transplanted islets. 1 out of 14 patients DIED due to immunosuppression complications. This is a LETHAL FLAW in the Vertex approach. The tradeoff of curing type 1 diabetes, but permanently weakening your immune system and greatly increasing chance of death due to simple infections is simply unacceptable for nearly all type 1 diabetes patients.. **How much is a type 1 diabetes cure worth?**. Let's look at some statistics to get a ballpark idea to guide us in valuing a type 1 diabetes cure.. Approximate number of type 1 diabetics in United States: 1.5 million     Worldwide: 9.1 million  ([source](. Average lifetime cost of type 1 diabetes per person in the United States is $500K ([source]( Given that, a reasonable cost for a type 1 diabetes cure might be some number less than $500K. For the sake of coming up with some estimate, let's assume that $SANA charges $100K for their type 1 diabetes cure (it could be more or it could be less).. Assume cost of type 1 diabetes cure is $100K:. $100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 1.5 million current U.S. patients = $150B U.S. revenue. $100K (assumed treatment cost)  \* 9.1 million current global patients = $910B global revenue. But what about new cases of type 1 diabetes each year?. About 52,000 people in the US and 503,000 people globally are newly diagnosed with type 1 diabetes each year ([source](. $100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 52K new U.S. patients = $5.2B new yearly U.S. revenue. $100K (assumed treatment cost) \* 503K new global patients = $50.3B new yearly global revenue. Again, these are just ballpark estimates, but the point is that a type 1 diabetes cure is a MASSIVE on the order of $100B to $1T opportunity. Certainly a company like $SANA, which has a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands is worth more than a measly $654M market cap, even factoring in things like potential dilution (more on that in a bit).. What's even more mind blowing is that $SANA'S immune evasive tech unlocks all sorts of other currently impossible therapies. Any lab-grown cell or tissue therapy will need $SANA'S proven immune evasive tech in order to work. Companies developing things like lab-grown liver tissue or blood vessels may license $SANA'S immune evasive technology, or $SANA may simply develop the therapies themselves. Taken together, $SANA has the potential to grow into a massive company. A $1T valuation further down the line would not be out of the question if they play their cards right. The market opportunity they have is not just massive, but legendary in size.. **Investor concerns (and why you shouldn't be concerned)**. At the moment, there are 2 main concerns that $SANA investors have:. 1. $SANA is running out of cash. They only have 2-3 quarters of runway left. This is true; however, here's why you shouldn't be concerned. Quite simply, $SANA has monumentally good data, and a type 1 diabetes cure on their hands. As was just discussed above, the market opportunity is massive. So massive that investors will not let the company run out of money. Since the amount of money to be made is so large and the impact so great, someone will foot the bill to keep the lights on. It's just a question of who and how much they will invest. And what the investment will look like.. Some of the largest investors in $SANA are Arch Ventures and Flagship Pioneering, 2 of the world's largest biotech $VC firms. Neither of these VCs has sold much of their initial stake and are likely underwater on their positions considering $SANA launched with $700M in funding (more reason to not anticipate too much dilution) ([source]( Jeff Bezo's fund Bezos Expeditions is also an original $SANA investor. It might be an extreme example, but Bezos could invest $1B in $SANA like it's nothing (he's given several $100M donations to various people in the past, why not help realize a type 1 diabetes cure?). The point is, there are wealthy people who want to see a type 1 diabetes cure realized (and/or make money off it) and together will be able to fund $SANA'S continued operations, especially as long as their data is promising (and it is promising). $SANA will not go bankrupt, data and market opportunity is too good.. An interesting thought: Since you know $SANA has to raise money in the next 2-3 quarters, you can logically assume that a funding announcement will likely occur within 2-3 quarters. This is likely to be a positive catalyst as it will provide investors with clarity. As discussed in the next section, I don't expect significant dilution, which brings me to the next investor concern.. 2. $SANA will be diluted significantly. It's true that common methods of raising more funding for a biotech running out of cash involve dilution, but there isn't reason to expect that $SANA would be diluted significantly if it raises dilutive funding. Consider again how great the market opportunity for $SANA to address is. It's reasonable to surmise that there are many, many investors that are clamoring to invest in $SANA now, but there is only a limited number of investors that they will be able to take on. What happens when a deal is competitive? A bidding war ensues and the valuation of the company increases. Investors are willing to put the same amount of money into a company for less of a percentage stake.. Basically, because $SANA is so promising, any dilutiion from fundraising is likely to be minimal. In cases where a biotech startup is in a danger of going bankrupt, but has questionable data, dilution can be massive (e.g. on the order of 90%), but $SANA is a complete opposite situation. They may only be diluted  10%. Or they may not be diluted at all if they pursue a partnership that provides upfront payments in exchange for something like royalties. In an extreme case, they may get a donation. Let's say they were diluted 50% (this seems unlikely to me), the valuation would now be around $1.3B instead of $650M (assuming the price stays the same and number of shares double). It would still be a ridiculously low valuation compared to the opportunity discussed above.. There are a large number of funding possibilities for $SANA and competition among investors is likely to be fierce. Vertex would be interested in $SANA tech, but so would Lilly (who makes insulin and whose business will suffer once a type 1 diabetes cure is available). This brings us to the next consideration. What could $SANA be acquired for?. **What's a reasonable acquisition price for $SANA? ($10B minimum)**. To get straight to the point, probably at least somewhere around $10B. $SANA is an extremely promising biotech and extremely promising biotechs have recently been acquired for around $10B. You can look in the news for several examples ([example]( but you really don't need to look any further than Juno therapeutics, which was acquired for $9B in 2018 ([source]( Why do I highlight Juno therapeutics? Because many of Sana's leadership/founders are former Juno leaders/founders. In other words, they are experienced and have been through an acquistion before. They know how to play the game. Frankly, I would think $SANA would be worth paying even more than $10B to acquire. Their market opportunity will go far beyond type 1 diabetes.. **Ok, I'm sold. How should I play $SANA? (not financial advice)**. Buy shares and hold. Just buy and hold as many shares as you can as long as the valuation is under $10B. And even at $10B valuation, they could potentially be an even more valuable company, so I'd probably keep holding a stake then too. I've been buying shares since the all time low and my most recent purchase was at $2.63 (as you can see in the first screenshot above). I don't think it really matters what price you get the shares at now. The stock, in my opinion, is ridiculously undervalued. Perhaps it was shorted as people worried about it going bankrupt or the tech not working or dilution, but as described above, I don't think those are real concerns.. As always, none of this is financial advice. Do your own due diligence. Hopefully this is some helpful DD to get you started."
$SANA unequivocally has Type 1 Diabetes cure and is massively undervalued. The case for $10B+ valuation and 10-20X+ returns.
For a minute there I thought the ticker he was spamming was $SAVA and I had flashbacks.
"I am hopeful for $SANA too and own shares, but the caveats are that they have only presented one patient worth of data! That too, from an IIT and not a formal clinical trial. . They need more data and more patients! The IIT is being conducted in Europe. They may have trouble finding patients there because insurance and nationalized healthcare covers insulin and such. . Vertex, with a clearly inferior product (requires long term immune suppression and is injected into portal vein, depositing cells into liver), was able to get 12 patients worth of data and about 10 times as much press and attention!. If Sana can‚Äôt recruit patients and show more data, they will falter and fail! Operational execution is key!"
"So, I have some $SANA but I most certainly am not going to bet the farm on this.  My reasons for buying in a small list and not the wall of text I doubt anyone in this thread has the attention span to read.. Any stocks tied to diabetes are hot right now and fluctuate.. The research is interesting and will cause small spikes as news breaks. . The stock has return potential if you buy low and monitor it then get out. . Reasons I will sell as soon as I get a decent return.. Solving diabetes means no recurring prescription driving revenue . Other diabetes treatments are also proving to help with weight loss not necessarily with people who have diabetes. This company won't have that."
Only $SANA I care about is in TWICE.
$HIMS will do a better diabetes cure and they have revenue
"$SANA is at least 10 years away from any marketable product that will generate revenue for DM2. They haven‚Äôt even started Phase 1 trials for their DM2 treatment. Don‚Äôt you honestly want to hold a stock for 10 years watching the price range from .01 to $5 for those 10 years? Yeah, if you get in now and hold you could have a big payoff in 10 years but this is not a get gains quick stock right now."

I‚Äôm bag holding $QCOM
"TL;DR - Reddit switched on machine translation for India on 28 Apr 2025, thereby exposing the world‚Äôs second-largest internet market to r/WallStreetBets. The chart above shows how $GOOGL is now funneling record numbers of new traffic (and thus new users) to Reddit.. India is a huge country. It doubles U.S. user counts on both YouTube and Facebook. Yet India is less than one-third the size of US users on Reddit. The upside here is thus enormous. If you overlay India‚Äôs early search-traffic curve on the launch-to-date growth for France, Spain, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil, India is clearly sprinting past every precedent.. The model I created on May 13 assumed France-style adoption rates (the yellow projection line). The latest Semrush data shows India blowing through that benchmark (the white dotted projection line).. Add in the bullish Anthropic lawsuit, the now-GA dynamic product ads feature, and Reddit Answers traction, their current \~20% sh\*rt int\*r\*st is starting to feel a tad mis-priced."
This is partly because $GOOGL is now pushing Reddit links to the top when you $GOOGL something and also because many Insta pages started to steal memes from Reddit thereby causing people to end up here when trying to find the original source.
The question you should be asking is who exactly still uses $GOOGL for search in 2025? . Does India not get DeepSeek or chat gtp for free on their phones?
"Are the curves for Spain, Colombia, France, etc. based on their actual user numbers after Reddit enabled machine translation in those countries (not likely as they all align)? I'm guessing they have been normalized/adjusted to match India‚Äôs starting traffic level at the time of India‚Äôs $MT launch (April 28, 2025) - so just relative growth trajectories I guess.. I.e. the France/Spain/Colombia/etc. lines are  adjusted to start at the same traffic level India had when $MT launched on April 28, 2025. Are the benchmark country lines scaled to preserve their absolute growth amounts or their growth rates? For example, if Mexico grew from 5M to 10M post-MT (i.e., +5M), would the chart show that as 60M ‚Üí 65M (preserving growth amount), or as 60M ‚Üí 120M (preserving growth rate)?"

"$MU options buyers are about to learn what ""IV crush"" is tomorrow.. Options chain pricing in an 8.25% move into close, and here we are fading at 3.75%. *laughing toothless Mexican*"
man I can't help but feel like $GOOGL is such a good play
"4k shares of $CLBR @ 17avg, am I cooked is mango saving us"
$MU is one of the worst tickers I know.
No way they are paying out all the $NVDA calls that expire this week 1.7mil
Even $TSLA is pumping. You know it‚Äôs bad lol
Sad pathetic pump on $MU
My $AMD puts are down bigly. The likes of which no one has ever seen before. Some might say they're biggliest ever.
if $MU would have missed just one earnings metric it would be sub $100 now.
$MU what an absolute fuking disgrace
$SOFI could have hired a monkey off the street to read the prepared interview script their CEO is giving
$TSLA is the most regarded stock
"If $RDDT could open at $150 again, that would be great."
How screwed are my $NVDA puts expiring this week
"Just because you are from $TX and own a gun, that does not make you a veteran or active duty soldier¬†"
There's no way $NVDA gonna open this green.
Sorry about the $TSLA drop guys. I bought calls on Monday
Elon going to announce you can drive your Tesla with neuralink by December to pump $TSLA again.
Some people play $NVDA. Some prepare chicken nuggets.
$NVDA 7/3 PUTS?
Looks like my $NVDA 160 calls will be itm at open
Imagine not buying $NVDA when it was 90$ because ‚ÄúdEeP sEeK‚Äù
Manifesting $CRCL to 150 tomorrow üôè
is $GOOGL gonna tease us with another 180 push? (probably yes because i sold at 170)
"$CLBR is a win-win for this sub, we will either get to witness the wildest gain or loss porn of the summer. true degens will love the outcome either way once gain/loss is realized. so shit talk or hype to your hearts content everyone, the winners and losers will be decided in a mere few weeks, pick a camp and settle in for the ride!"
Let's go $MU üêÇ
"$NVDA is insane, bruh. Nothing's stopping that train. I just hope $AMD continues to bask in the reflective glory."
Those $MU numbers are damn good.
$AMD will be $160 tomorrow
$TSLA V?
"$MU Earnings:. - Revenue of $9.30 billion versus $8.05 billion for the prior quarter and $6.81 billion for the same period last year. - GAAP net income of $1.89 billion, or $1.68 per diluted share. - Non-GAAP net income of $2.18 billion, or $1.91 per diluted share. - Operating cash flow of $4.61 billion versus $3.94 billion for the prior quarter and $2.48 billion for the same period last year. ‚ÄúMicron delivered record revenue in fiscal Q3, driven by all-time-high DRAM revenue including nearly 50% sequential growth in $HBM revenue. Data center revenue more than doubled year-over-year and reached a quarterly record, and consumer-oriented end markets had strong sequential growth,‚Äù said Sanjay Mehrotra, Chairman, President and CEO of Micron Technology. ‚ÄúWe are on track to deliver record revenue with solid profitability and free cash flow in fiscal 2025, while we make disciplined investments to build on our technology leadership and manufacturing excellence to satisfy growing AI-driven memory demand.‚Äù"
$MU fighting for its life lmaooo
"NOW HALF YOU FOMO'ING SONS OF BITCHES ARE GOING TO YEET INTO $NVDA THINKING $200 IS COMING NEXT WEEK.. I mean, well, it could."
did my Robinhood Legend bug out or did $TSLA jump to 340 a bit ago?
puts on $ASTS
$NVDA puts lets do this
Krispy Kreme will soon be announcing they are scraping the McDonald‚Äôs expansion. $DNUT puts are gonna be my go to.
Need a 2% pullback on $AMD tomorrow
Damn that $MU fade big sad lmao
$MU a theta gang wet dream
"$MU did not fool me, again. I try to learn lessons once."
Let $MU fall and buy it when it goes back up tomorrow
Holding my $TSLA 320 puts. Tomorrow I'll see you at the drive thru or you'll see me
"Seriously don't understand why anyone would even look at $MU.¬†. It's just memory. Samsung, Hynix, $LPL and pretty much every F-tarded Asian company can make it. If there's some special IP, they'll just copy it or the customer can simply add more memory that's little bit slower but a lot cheaper.¬†. Explain to me why.. Also, explain the price fizzle out from 6.5% to 0% in AH today, while at it.¬†"
If you think $MU tanking after earnings is bad. Just know I sold my entire position in $MU at $64 in April. Literally the pin point bottom. I can‚Äôt do anything but fucking laugh at myself.
Damn $MU options holders got rekt
"I've learned my lesson. Lost about 1k this week so far (I am a new trader) doing option calls on companies such as $UCO, $KTOS, and the most important 0DTE call option on QQQ.. Since the war started between Israel and Iran, I've chickened my way out of potentially great profit from $ASTS.. Today, i was very hopeful with my QQQ calls, but unfortunately, I've lost a big chunk of my portfolio. Regardless, the lesson was learned not to play with ODTE calls or puts. It's safe to say that my balls aren't that bigüòÇ.. So now I have a new plan of action. NO MORE SHORT CALL OPTIONS! Tomorrow, i will purchase a call option for $RKLB at the expiration date of 89 days. Slow and easy wins the race.. We are all here to make some extra cash, so I wish you all successful trading calls/puts/ or simply just holding shares until it reaches the moon!. Cheers"
$MU chart looking like a middle finger to my calls rn
"BUT CAN WE FINALLY GET SOME VOLUME ON $UNH, MAKE IT GO UP OR DOWN IDC ANYMORE AT THIS POINT.. GIVE . ME . VOLUME"
. wonder what that means for my $UNH bags..probably going to zero as is tradition
I bought $NVDA at 96 and sold at 98 looking for the 91 dip buy.¬† Clown hat please
$UNH - fast road to nowhere
She‚Äôs a 2 but buys $TMCWW calls
$UBER to $102
damn my $NVDA puts are cooked
I wanna see $TSLA dump 10%
"Sold my JUN27 $MSFT 492.5C for a $1.70ea on Tuesday, for like 150% profit thinking 'Nah, this shit gonna dump'.. Also unloaded half my JUL18 500C for a tidy profit.. The hindsight greed is tough"
$RDDT gonna moon again today? My loads are ready
Is $TSLA still fuk???
"Holy smokes! $NVDA, I hope I have thanked you enough!"
Was hoping for a war.   . Now stuck with $LMT and $RTX.
I unfortunately had to sell like 300 shares of $PLTR to buy myself a truck earlier this year cus I deserve it (and also mainly cus my 12 year old beater sedan was biting the dust) but damn do I wish I had 300 more shares of it rn üòî
". Brothers who see this picture, let's make $MMM together and fuck Ukrainian bitches LOL"
I sold a good bunch of $PLTR stock at about $15 to buy a house which ended up falling through. Watching the climb over the past year has been painful.
Is $PLTR already not too high?
. I think $IBKR has the answer for you
Get a shark loan and then double it or nothing on 3 $DTG Spy calls of $660 and by the power of Wall Street bets degeneracy you‚Äôll double your loss to 8k
Losing money on $CRCL. Got to the party when the punch bowl was emptied out
Try $MCTR + Z usually this helps.
Wait until you see $CRCL lol
"Puts before the 4th of July? RIP. Big Don ain't letting stocks go down, let alone $PLTR before Independence Day."
$HIMS to the moonüöÄü¶Ö
$HIMS to the moon then sells calls against it? Lol
What make $HIMS different?
$HIMS $25 coming to a RH chart near you
I‚Äôm short $MSFT here
"I see everyone calling you a retard or whatever. I think this is a reasonable gamble. $MSFT p/e is the highest it's been in the last 6 years. Generally it averages between 32-33, It's almost 40 now.   . As you said it's been on a tear since earnings and its due for a pull back. . My only feedback would be to maybe buy your puts in 3-4 blocks over the next few weeks, in case it stays flat for a while or has a bit of momentum still left. People saying things like moat and good management don't seem to understand that good stocks can be overbought and oversold as well. Between July 2024 - May 2025 $MSFT returned -23% because it was also previously overbought. . Good luck."
"While I don't disagree with you shorting $MSFT, why not sell call spreads?"
OP bought Puts at today's low of the day for $MSFT. He saw green for probably 5 mins max. It is now all red from here.
Betting against $MSFT is a foolish play.
I bought $MSFT 490P 7/18 when it was at $468.. still diamond handing but at this point i just accepted that its a lost cause lol my breakeven is $466.7
I‚Äôve been absolutely wrecked on 9/19 $MSFT puts at $400 and $380 purchased towards May EOM. . We‚Äôll see if it shows any weakness in the next few weeks but I‚Äôm exiting by July EOM if not.
"Stock market might be regarded right now but if the tariffs aren't lifted by taco (he probably will not until his trade deals are made which no one seems to even be fully cooperating for) then it is an inevitability for a decent correction. Microsoft isn't some unstoppable beast like people are making it out to be, sooner or later the tariffs WILL hit, and it'll be out of nowhere like every other economic slowdown has been like.. The way I see $MSFT, it's on a huge streak since its earnings because it's being viewed as a safe investment among the mania and it does feel safe considering it's only been going up since the earnings, but it is being very overbought like you said, and it will take just one bad day for people to get spooked out of buying it.. Honestly a good play and I think it'll print, maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next week, but the market will slow down eventually as I do not see taco doing the signature taco move for tariffs. This stock is being priced as if we're in normal, uneventful times but we're not.. Also, I need a good entry for this dumbass stock so I am also praying this play will be the call of the month."
"Doesn‚Äôt matter how good $GOOGL is. If the market wants to go down, you‚Äôre going down with it."
We need more warriors like you. Bring $GOOGL back to all time high. Please
"Yes... because $PLTR should have died already next to $TSLA and this motherf....s keep going up, I swear nothing will make me more insane than some of these tickers...."
I agree with some comments. I would take profits too !  There are so many of you with $PLTR - retail trader who struck it big.  The stock is great but so overbought and traded.  The valuation is insane. I would think it would continue to climb slowly but I‚Äôve seen stocks sink overnight and ppl move on from the name - you think it won‚Äôt happen or that it can‚Äôt and boom . Just my opinion. But good trade. !! Congrats
now put it all into $SRFM if you have balls
What‚Äôs your opinion on a $PLTR OPTION?
"Whoever posted $TMCWW DD 2 weeks ago, I love you"
"Where are all the $TMCWW haters?üòÇ congrats! I‚Äôm still holding 1,000 shares plus 5 call contracts. Took profits on 500 shares and 25 call contracts. We are hitting $10 in a few days."
"John Oliver did a thing on this company a year ago and I have been watching it since. I can‚Äôt explain why I didn‚Äôt buy and hold between .90 and $2 but I am not willing to touch it now. Pretty sure this will go down with me also buying 1000 shares of $PLTR at $10 and selling at $9 because I had just started trading and thought I was going to lose all my money, lol."
$AMD - Diamond Hands? Nah. Lisa Hands‚Ñ¢
"Been investing in $AMD since I read the announcement that she was going to become the new CEO and that she was going to turn that business around, which she did. At that time, the stock was $7. She has proven that she was, is and has been a great CEO choice for $AMD"
"imagine having the money to buy $AMD calls, but not pic collage watermark removal üò≠"
I guess that when a stock earns a name like money destroyer it probably destroyed enough money to be worth buying.. $INTC here I come!
$AMD has been killing it. Good for them. I switched from Nvidia recently for my GPU so you're welcome by the way
I watched $RKLB go sideways for months and then sold at a slight loss. I watched it moon 26% this past week and felt like the Interstellar dude.
"""If you can't love me at my 85, then you don't deserve me at my 150."" - $NVDA"
"$CLBR CEO on today‚Äôs SPACInsider podcast said there‚Äôs no PIPE agreement which means no dilution upon ticker change to PEW. If redemptions are high, which I suspect they will be, then PEW could be trading with an extremely small float on ticker change day. I‚Äôm pretty sure $NMAX was in the same boat and it went $14 to $200 in the first few days. . This play is truly as regarded as it gets but I kinda am seeing the vision now."
Imagine being one of those regards that panic sold $NVDA during the tariff panic ü§°
"So when $NVDA was dumping a few months ago, price targets were in the toilet. Now that it's pumping, price targets are mooning. I think analysts are just regarded momentum traders."
$ASTS back down to $20 hopefully so I can miss getting back in again
$ASTS is really gonna rebound from -8 to green in just a few hours üöÄ
just a friendly reminder to anyone not feeling fomo that $NVDA is almost up 100% from reciprocal tariffs low LOL
damn someone just fast-forward me to $CLBR merger so I know if I'm up $500K or down $50K
AI is propping up the market. I wonder if we'll get a 2000 dotcom-style crash when we finally figure out that getting to $AGI will be harder than we thought.
$GOOGL another solid 1% today ü§û how pathetic to be a $GOOGL shareholder damn me man
$NVDA and $MSFT neck and neck racing to 4T while apple üí© is nowhere to be found.
"$AMD green every day now, I think the apocalypse is here"
I wanna load $NVDA puts at these levels but I‚Äôm scared
Exited my $CRCL short from -95K loss to +15K gain. MF bitch gave me multiple sleepless nights
"If you ever feel bad, there's someone out there that bought $WOLF at 142,33. Now is trading at 0,58$"
just remember that someone bought $CRCL at 300
Imagine buying the top on $CRCL and $ASTS on back to back days? Hahaha imagine??? Imagine doing that??? Haha imagine??? ü§°ü§°ü§°üëàüëàüëà üò≠üò≠
I buy $NVDA puts one time and goes straight up
$NVDA on the brink of ATH and most of tech green and moving upwards but SPY is absolutely struggling to keep from dropping like a rock is truly something. I should just start playing individual tickers instead of SPY these days
"I‚Äôve seen some drawn out distribution stages before, but this one takes the cake. The institutions just rigged the market for nearly 2 and 1/2 months so they could unload their shares to the dumbest of retail participants right below $ATHS."
$NVDA casually pumping 4% and pulling semi‚Äôs up on 0 news whilst the rest of market starts to go red wtf lmao
"$NVDA has had an erection lasting longer then 4 hours, should we be concerned?"
"Tomorrow,  $NVDA and $GOOGL rug pull, tesla pump, $AMD to the grave, some fucking shit biotech 900%"
might be highly regarded but im eating up this $CLBR dip wish me luck
"There is a guy at work, who was hired 3 months ago. He‚Äôs so bad at his job that hiring manager now thinks he used ChatGPT during interviews. He did a presentation yesterday when a senior exec asked me, ‚Äúwas he just reading ChatGPT?‚Äù. All this to say, calls on $NVDA."
